Laparoscopic approach for metachronous cecal and sigmoid volvulus.
Metachronous colonic volvulus is a rare event that has never been approached laparoscopically. Here we discuss the case of a 63-year-old female with a metachronous sigmoid and cecal volvulus. The patient underwent 2 separate successful laparoscopic resections. The following is a discussion of the case and the laparoscopic technique, accompanied by a brief review of colonic volvulus. In experienced hands, laparoscopy is a safe approach for acute colonic volvulus.
