Fluids and nutrition: perspectives from Jewish Law (Halachah).
The use of nutrition and hydration in the terminally ill had been considered normal supportive measures until recently. Currently, many institutions, health care personnel and family members hold that nutrition and hydration are extraordinary measures that may be terminated. A case is offered to discuss the ruling by traditional Jewish law (Halachah) on the issue of nutrition and hydration. Judaism upholds the supreme sanctity of human life. Fluids and nutrition are considered as ordinary supportive measures rather than heroic. Withholding of fluids and nutrition is inconsistent with Jewish law. These modalities are neither withheld nor withdrawn on the patient with the brain tumor, dementia, and previous wishes not to be kept alive with machines.
