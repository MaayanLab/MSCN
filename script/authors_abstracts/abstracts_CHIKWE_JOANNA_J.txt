Incidence, epidemiology, and prognosis of residual pulmonary hypertension after mitral valve repair for degenerative mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common sequela of degenerative mitral valve disease, but the regression of PH after mitral surgery is often incomplete. We sought to identify the preoperative risk factors for residual PH after mitral valve repair and its effect on the clinical outcome. The outcomes in 71 patients with preoperative PH (mean pulmonary arterial pressure ?25 mm Hg) were compared according to the presence or absence of residual PH 24 hours after mitral valve surgery. Of 71 patients, 33 (46%) had residual PH. The remainder experienced significant reductions in the mean pulmonary arterial pressure without changes in pulmonary vascular resistance. Patients with residual PH had significantly elevated postoperative pulmonary vascular resistance (despite a significant decrease from the preoperative baseline) compared to those without residual PH. Residual PH was an independent risk factor for postoperative morbidity, mortality, and a prolonged intensive care unit stay (odds ratio 4.0, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 13.1, p = 0.02), independent of the preoperative mean pulmonary arterial pressure. A decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.8 to 1.0, p = 0.007) and fibroelastic deficiency (odds ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 11.8, p = 0.03) were independent predictors of residual PH. In conclusion, residual PH is a clinically important entity common after mitral valve repair for degenerative disease and is associated with clinical variables that aid in the preoperative prediction of at-risk patients.

Predictors and outcomes of seizures after cardiac surgery: a multivariable analysis of 2,578 patients.
Limited data exist regarding the epidemiology and prognosis of seizures in adults after cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to define preoperative predictors of seizures and impact on postoperative outcomes. A prospective database of 2,578 consecutive adults who underwent cardiac surgery at a single institution between April 2007 and December 2009 was retrospectively analyzed to determine risk factors for postoperative seizures and prognostic impact. No patient received tranexamic acid or aprotinin. Seizures occurred in 31 patients (1%) at a median of 2 days postoperatively (1 patient had a preoperative diagnosis of seizure disorder). Seizures were classified as generalized tonic-clonic (71%), simple/complex partial (26%), or status epilepticus (3%). Incidence differed according to procedure (coronary bypass 0.1%, isolated valve 1%, valve/coronary bypass 3%, aorta 5%; p <0.001). Patients who experienced seizures had nearly a fivefold higher operative mortality than patients who did not (29% versus 6%, p <0.001). Head computed tomography was performed in 26 patients (84%), of whom ischemic strokes were identified in 14 cases (53%). These were embolic in 9 patients (34%), and watershed in 3 (12%). Hemorrhagic strokes were observed in 2 patients (8%). The occurrence of a new postoperative stroke in seizure patients did not significantly increase the likelihood of in-hospital death. Thirteen patients (41%) were discharged without neurologic deficit. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified three risk factors for seizure: deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, aortic calcification or atheroma, and critical preoperative state. Seizures in adults after cardiac surgery are strong independent predictors of permanent neurologic deficit and increased operative mortality. Early head computed tomography may be indicated to identify treatable pathology.

Frailty: the missing element in predicting operative mortality.
Although age is an extensively documented independent risk factor for mortality, morbidity and decreased quality of life after cardiac surgery, it has also been demonstrated that excellent outcomes can be obtained after cardiac surgery in very elderly patients. The disparity between chronological and biological age that underlies these findings forms the focus of this review, which examines recent studies aiming to refine pre-operative risk stratification tools by using assessments of frailty and functional status.

Prosthetic valve selection for middle-aged patients with aortic stenosis.
Choosing the optimal aortic valve prosthesis for middle-aged patients (late 40s to early 60s) with aortic stenosis presents a challenge. The available options all have substantial drawbacks that must be considered in the decision-making process. Current data indicate that there is little or no difference in survival between mechanical and bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement in middle-aged patients at 10-15 years after surgery. Patients who receive a mechanical valve replacement have an annual risk of major hemorrhagic or embolic events of 2-4% per year for life compared with about 1% per year for patients who have a bioprosthetic valve. However, bioprostheses are associated with an increasing risk of structural valve degeneration from 10 years postimplantation, and most patients will require reoperation if they survive much longer than a decade. The mortality risk associated with reoperation is similar to that of primary surgery for most patients, and does not seem to impact on the 15-year survival in this patient group. The Ross procedure, in which the aortic valve is replaced with a pulmonary autograft, can provide improved freedom from morbidity, but operative mortality is probably double that of isolated aortic valve replacement and most patients will require reoperation. Informed patient choice is the most important factor in deciding which valve to use, with biological valves increasingly favored over mechanical valves in middle-aged patients.

A propensity score-adjusted retrospective comparison of early and mid-term results of mitral valve repair versus replacement in octogenarians.
Feasibility and efficacy of mitral repair in the elderly remain controversial. This study aims to compare outcomes of mitral repair and replacement in octogenarians. We compared the outcomes of 322 consecutive octogenarian patients (mean age 82.6 ± 2.2 years) who underwent mitral repair (n = 227, 70%) or replacement (n = 95, 30%) at Mount Sinai Medical Center and Leipzig Herzzentrum between 1998 and 2008 using propensity score adjustment and univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients undergoing aortic valve replacement were excluded. Coronary bypass was performed in 47.5% (n = 153), and 31.1% (n = 100) required tricuspid repair. Propensity score adjustment yielded comparable groups. Thirty-day mortality in patients undergoing primary elective mitral repair for degenerative disease was 5.1% (2/39). Overall 90-day mortality was 18.9% (43/227) for repair compared with 31.6% (30/95) for replacement (P = 0.014). Pre-discharge echocardiography revealed less than moderate residual regurgitation in 99% of patients (231/232). Adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival for patients undergoing mitral repair was 71 ± 3, 61 ± 4, and 59 ± 4%, respectively, compared with 56 ± 5, 50 ± 6, and 45 ± 6% for patients undergoing mitral replacement (P = 0.046). Multivariate analysis demonstrated emergency surgery, previous myocardial infarction, concomitant coronary artery bypass surgery, and mitral replacement to be strong independent predictors of early mortality; mitral valve replacement was an independent predictor of reduced survival in degenerative patients. Elective mitral repair can be performed with low operative mortality and good long-term outcomes in selected octogenarians with degenerative mitral disease, and is associated with better long-term survival than mitral replacement. The survival benefit associated with surgery for non-degenerative disease is more questionable.

Surgical strategies for functional tricuspid regurgitation.
Functional or secondary tricuspid regurgitation commonly is found in the setting of left-sided heart disease and, when severe, is associated with substantially poorer functional outcomes and survival if untreated. The traditional view that functional tricuspid regurgitation generally resolves with surgical correction of the primary lesions is no longer held. Data showing late development of severe tricuspid regurgitation in patients with mild regurgitation at time of mitral valve surgery have heralded a new era of aggressive intervention on the tricuspid valve. Tricuspid ring annuloplasty can be performed with minimal incremental morbidity and negligible additional mortality. Therefore, in addition to patients with severe regurgitation, annuloplasty is now also recommended for patients with risk factors for developing late tricuspid insufficiency (typically patients with moderate tricuspid regurgitation or severe annular dilation at time of left-sided cardiac procedures). In this work we review the current indications for tricuspid valve repair in patients undergoing other cardiac surgery operations and also the various options available to the surgeon.

Current diagnosis and management of left main coronary disease.
Left main coronary artery (LMCA) disease remains an important risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity at all stages of diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease. Left main stem pathology is often silent, with unpredictable presentation: as such it poses diagnostic and management challenges. This article reviews the anatomy, epidemiology and diagnosis of left main stem disease, as well as advances in multidisciplinary concepts of diagnosis and management, and summarises the outcomes of recent prospective studies comparing percutaneous and surgical revascularisation in LMCA disease.

The impact of moderate-to-end-stage renal failure on outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
Currently, established renal failure is a well-recognized risk factor for operative mortality in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The authors aimed to establish the relative impact of dialysis-dependent renal failure (DRF) and nondialysis-dependent renal failure (NDRF) on early and late outcome after CABG surgery. A retrospective cohort study. A single teaching hospital. The authors analyzed prospectively collected data from 2,960 adult patients who underwent isolated CABG surgery between 1998 and 2006 at the authors' institution, according to whether they had preoperative NDRF based on preoperative creatinine >2.5 mg/dL, DRF, or neither (controls). CABG surgery. Outcome measures included hospital mortality, postoperative complications, length of stay, and survival. Hospital mortality was 1.8% (n = 52). Patients in the NDRF and DRF groups had a significantly increased mortality (8.3%, n = 13) compared with the control group (1.4%, n = 39), and both NDRF (odds ratio [OR] = 6.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.3-16.5; p < 0.001) and DRF (OR = 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-10.0; p = 0.004) were found to be independent predictors of operative mortality. The overall mean follow-up was 3.9 +/- 2.5 years. Multivariate analysis revealed DRF (OR = 5.1) to be an independent predictor of late mortality after cardiac surgery, whereas NDRF was not found to be an independent predictor of late mortality. Preoperative renal failure is an independent risk factor for adverse early and late outcomes after CABG surgery. NDRF is associated with increased hospital mortality and major morbidity compared with patients with lesser degrees of renal dysfunction, but also compared with DRF patients.

Comparison of the results of aortic valve replacement with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < or =30% versus patients with ejection fraction >30%.
The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that low-ejection fraction (EF), low-gradient aortic stenosis (AS) is a predictor of major morbidity after aortic valve replacement (AVR). We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from 597 consecutive patients with AS (mean age 72 +/- 11 years) who had undergone AVR or combined AVR and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) from 1998 to 2006 (EF < or =30% in 73 [12%]). The outcome measures included hospital mortality, major complications, and long-term survival. The overall hospital mortality rate was 4% (low-EF AS 5%; low-EF AS plus CABG 8%; AS controls 4%; AS plus CABG controls 3%; p = 0.42). Low-EF, low-gradient AS was not an independent risk factor for hospital mortality but predicted stroke (odds ratio [OR] 4.3), deep sternal wound infection (OR 10.0), sepsis (OR 6.8), gastrointestinal complications (OR 4.2), and respiratory failure (OR 4.4). The survival rate at 1, 3, and 5 years was 69 +/- 8%, 69 +/- 8%, and 65 +/- 8% in the low-EF, low-gradient, AVR plus CABG group and 95 +/- 4%, 92 +/- 5%, and 82 +/- 7% in the low-EF, low-gradient AVR group compared to 93 +/- 2%, 88 +/- 2%, and 78 +/- 3% in the AVR plus CABG control group and 93 +/- 2%, 89 +/- 2%, and 85 +/- 3% in the AVR control group (p = 0.001), respectively. In the patients with low-EF AS who experienced major postoperative morbidity, the 1-year survival rate was significantly reduced (54 +/- 14%) compared to those who did not (95 +/- 3%, p <0.001). In conclusion, low-EF, low-gradient AS is a predictor of increased major morbidity after AVR, which nonetheless remains the treatment of choice for most patients because of the excellent early and late survival. However, patients with strong risk factors for postoperative renal and respiratory failure might derive less benefit from conventional surgical AVR.

Current concepts in ablation of atrial fibrillation.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in clinical practice. It occurs particularly frequently in cardiac surgical patients and is associated with significant excess mortality and morbidity. Pharmacological management of AF is relatively ineffective and associated with significant side effects and complications. Clinicians have therefore pursued more definitive treatment options, both catheter based and surgical, to treat patients with AF. Surgical techniques designed to cure AF have developed in parallel with an improved understanding of the pathophysiological processes underlying this condition. This review describes the rationale behind current surgical approaches to AF and summarizes the results achieved with current techniques.

State of the art: degenerative mitral valve disease.
Mitral valve repair offers superior long-term survival, freedom from cardiac morbidity, and quality of life in patients with severe mitral regurgitation compared to medical management and mitral valve replacement; it is the treatment of choice in these patients. Mitral valve repair is the only treatment that restores normal life expectancy to otherwise healthy patients with advanced degenerative mitral valve disease. This review focuses on indications, timing and techniques for mitral valve repair in degenerative disease, emphasising the importance of anatomy in surgical outcomes.

Predicting postoperative renal failure requiring dialysis, and an analysis of long-term outcome in patients undergoing valve surgery.
Previous studies have been unable to identify independent valve-related risk factors for the occurrence of renal failure requiring dialysis (RF-D) in patients undergoing valve surgery. The study aim was to determine the incidence and predictors of renal failure in these patients, and to create a model based on these risk factors that could serve as a tool to predict this complication. Between January 1998 and December 2006, a total of 2,690 consecutive patients (1,546 males, 1,144 females; mean age 64 +/- 15 years) underwent valve or combined valve/coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery at the authors' institution. The main outcome investigated was postoperative RF-D; other postoperative parameters investigated included hospital mortality, major morbidity, length of hospital stay, discharge condition and late survival. RF-D occurred in 70 patients (2.6%). Multivariate analysis revealed preoperative renal failure (creatinine >2.5 mg/dl) (OR = 4.3), endocarditis (OR = 3.0), congestive heart failure (OR = 2.4), reoperation (OR = 2.3), diabetes (OR = 3.1) and cardiopulmonary bypass time >180 min (OR = 1.7) as independent predictors for postoperative RF-D. Hospital mortality among patients with RF-D was 50% (n = 35) compared to a mortality rate of 3.2% (n = 87) in patients without this complication (p <0.001). The long-term survival of discharged patients with RF-D was significantly decreased compared to those without RF-D. A logistic equation which included the coefficients of the regression analysis was generated to calculate an individual patient's risk for the development of renal failure. The predictive accuracy of the model and validation was measured (ROC area under the curve = 0.750). Renal failure requiring dialysis is a well-known complication, particularly in patients undergoing complex valve operations, such as surgery for endocarditis and double-valve procedures. The poor long-term survival of patients with RF-D underlines the need to direct more resources towards the prevention and treatment of this complication in valve surgery patients.

Logistic risk model predicting postoperative respiratory failure in patients undergoing valve surgery.
Previous studies have been unable to identify independent valve-related risk factors for postoperative respiratory failure (RF) in patients undergoing valve surgery. This study was designed to determine the incidence and predictors of RF in these patients. We also aimed to create a model based on these risk factors that could serve as a tool for the prediction of this complication. We analyzed prospectively collected data of 2808 patients (mean age 63+/-15 years, 43% female) who underwent valve surgery from January 1998 to December 2006. Isolated valve surgery was performed in 2007 (72%) patients whereas 801 (28%) received concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures. The main outcome investigated was RF (ventilation >72 h). Other postoperative parameters included in the analysis were hospital mortality, morbidity, length of hospital stay, discharge and late survival. Respiratory failure occurred in 12.2% (n=342) of patients. The incidence of RF varied according to the procedures (single valve: 7.4-15.8%; multiple valves: 21.7-23.4%). The addition of CABG significantly increased the rate of RF (isolated valves: 10.8%, combined valve/CABG 15.7%, p<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed preoperative renal failure, ejection fraction <30%, age >70 years, active endocarditis, emergent procedures, reoperation, diabetes, congestive heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, female gender, double aortic and mitral valve procedures, and cardiopulmonary bypass time >180 min as independent predictors of RF. Hospital mortality among patients with RF was 22.2% (n=76) versus 2.7% (n=66) in the control group (p<0.001). A logistic equation including the coefficients of the regression analysis was generated to calculate an individual patient's risk for the development of RF. Predictive accuracy of the model and validation was measured (ROC area under the curve: 0.751). Long-term survival of discharged patients with RF was significantly decreased compared to those without RF. Respiratory failure is a common complication particularly in patients undergoing complex valve operations such as endocarditis or multiple valve procedures. The independent predictors of RF including valve-related factors allowed us to create a predictive model with great accuracy. The poor long-term survival of patients with RF underlines the need to direct more resources towards prevention and treatment of this complication.

Prosthesis type has minimal impact on survival after valve surgery in patients with moderate to end-stage renal failure.
Few previous studies have reported on the outcome of patients with renal failure (RF) undergoing valvular surgery, particularly with regard to choice of valve prosthesis. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from 155 patients with RF (mean age 62 +/- 14, 42% female) who underwent left-sided valve surgery from January 1998 to December 2006. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (non-dialysis-dependent renal failure (NDRF); creatinine >2.5 mg/dl; n = 47, 40%) and Group 2 (renal failure dialysis (DRF); n = 108, 60%). Mechanical valves were implanted in 50 (32%) patients and bioprostheses in 63 (41%). Isolated mitral valve reconstruction was performed in 27% (n = 42) of patients. Outcome measures included hospital mortality, major postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, discharge planning and late survival. The overall hospital mortality was 19.3% (n = 30) and was not different between Groups 1 (23%) and 2 (18%). Ejection fraction, peripheral vascular disease, aortic valve replacement and reoperation were independent predictors of hospital mortality. One- and five-year survival rates were 74.4 +/- 7.8% and 53.1 +/- 10.1% in Group 1 and 75.8 +/- 4.6% and 49.1 +/- 7.1% in Group 2 (P = ns), respectively. According to the type of prostheses, hospital mortality and freedom from reoperation were similar in patients with mechanical and biological valves. Five-year survival rate was 51 +/- 10.7 for biological valves versus 55 +/- 8.4 for mechanical valves (P = ns). Hospital mortality and morbidity remain high in patients with RF undergoing valvular surgery and it is not different in NDRF and DRF patients. This study suggests that the type of valve prosthesis does not appear to have an impact on early and late survival but is limited by sample size. It may be that bioprostheses should be more widely used in patients with RF requiring valve replacement.

Tricuspid valve repair for treatment and prevention of secondary tricuspid regurgitation in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery.
Secondary or functional tricuspid regurgitation occurring late after mitral valve surgery is associated with high morbidity and mortality. In this article, we review the pathophysiology of secondary tricuspid regurgitation and the evidence supporting the use of tricuspid valve annuloplasty for preventing and treating secondary tricuspid regurgitation. Liberal application of tricuspid valve annuloplasty is recommended to prevent progression of secondary regurgitation, as contrary to widely held opinion, fixing the left-sided valve dysfunction often does not resolve secondary tricuspid valve dysfunction. Based on existing literature, assessing the tricuspid valve annular dimensions can be recommended as part of all mitral valve operations, and annuloplasty strongly considered in patients with tricuspid annular dilatation or moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.

Cardiac anesthesia and surgery in geriatric patients.
The average age of US population is steadily increasing, with more than 15 million people aged 80 and older. Coronary artery disease and degenerative cardiovascular diseases are particularly prevalent in this population. Consequently, an increasing number of elderly patients are referred for surgical intervention. Advanced age is associated with decreased physiologic reserve and significant comorbidity. Thorough preoperative assessment, identification of the risk factors for perioperative morbidity and mortality, and optimal preparation are critical in these patients. Age-related changes in comorbidities and altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics impacts anesthetic management, perioperative monitoring, postoperative care, and outcome. This article updates the age-related changes in organ subsystems relevant to cardiac anesthesia, perioperative issues, and intraoperative management. Early and late operative outcome in octogenarians undergoing cardiac surgery are reviewed. The data clearly indicate that no patient group is "too old" for cardiac surgery and that excellent outcomes can be achieved in selected group of elderly patients.

Predictors and early and late outcomes of respiratory failure in contemporary cardiac surgery.
Respiratory failure (RF) is a serious complication following heart surgery. The profile of patients referred for cardiac surgery has changed during the last decade, making prior investigations of RF after cardiac surgery less relevant to the current population. This study was designed to analyze the incidence, predictors of RF, and early and late outcomes following this complication in a large contemporary cardiac surgery population. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from the New York State Department of Health database including 5,798 patients undergoing cardiac surgery between January 1998 and December 2005. Patients with RF (intubation time > or = 72 h) were compared to patients without RF. The incidence of RF was 9.1% (n = 529). The highest incidence of RF was observed following combined valve/coronary artery bypass graft (14.8%) and aortic procedures (13.5%). Multivariate analysis revealed preoperative and operative predictors of RF such as renal failure (odds ratio [OR], 2.3), aortic procedures (OR, 2.6), hemodynamic instability (OR, 3.2), and intraaortic balloon pump (OR, 2.6). The mortality rate following RF was 15.5% (n = 82), compared to 2.4% (n = 126) in the no-RF group (p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed significantly poorer survival among RF patients (p < 0.001) compared to the no-RF group. RF remains a serious and common complication following cardiac surgery, particularly in patients undergoing complex procedures. RF is associated with significant comorbidity, increased hospital mortality, and reduced long-term survival. Future research efforts should focus on a more precise identification of patients at risk and the development of new treatment modalities that would potentially prevent the occurrence of this complication.

Results and predictors of early and late outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft surgery in octogenarians.
The aim of this study was to investigate early and late outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in a large cohort of octogenarian patients. The results were compared with 2 other age groups including septuagenarians and patients <70 years old. A retrospective study of consecutive patients undergoing CABG surgery using a computerized database based on the New York State Department of Health registry. Data collection was performed prospectively. Setting: A university hospital (single institution). Two thousand nine hundred eighty-five patients undergoing CABG surgery including 282 (9.4%) octogenarians, 852 (28.6%) septuagenarians, and 1851 (62%) patients younger than 70 years old. None. Patient characteristics, hospital mortality, morbidity, length of stay, and long-term survival were analyzed. Octogenarians were more likely female and presented significantly more often with comorbidities such as heart failure, an ejection fraction <30%, peripheral vascular disease, and aortic calcification. Crude hospital mortality was 4.6% (n = 13) in octogenarians compared with 2.2% (n = 19) in septuagenarians and 2.4% (n = 44) in patients <70 years old (p = 0.067). Respiratory failure and gastrointestinal complications occurred more frequently in octogenarians. The stroke rate was 1.6% and similar in the 3 age groups. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, age >80 years was not a predictor of hospital mortality. The length of stay was significantly higher in octogenarians compared with nonoctogenarians (16 +/- 24 days v 10 +/- 13 days, p < 0.001). Five-year survival was 63% +/- 4% in octogenarians and was similar to that of an age- and sex-matched general US population. Excellent results after CABG surgery can be expected in octogenarians, with a minimal increase in postoperative mortality and acceptable postoperative morbidity. Respiratory failure is the main postoperative complication in octogenarians. Recent advances in operative techniques and perioperative management have contributed in improving surgical outcome in these patients compared with historic reports.

Excellent early and late outcomes of aortic valve replacement in people aged 80 and older.
To investigate early and late outcome of aortic valve replacement (AVR) in a large cohort of patients aged 80 and older. Retrospective study of consecutive patients undergoing AVR using a computerized database based on the New York State Department of Health registry. Data collection was performed prospectively. University hospital (single institution). One thousand three hundred eight patients undergoing AVR (231 (17.6%) aged > or = 80, 1,077 (82.4%) < 80). Patient characteristics, hospital mortality, morbidity, length of stay and long-term survival were analyzed. Subjects aged 80 and older were more likely to be female, had a lower body mass index, and presented significantly more often with comorbidities such as heart failure, renal failure, and extensive aortic calcification. Crude hospital mortality was 5.2% (n=12) in subjects age 80 and older, compared with 4.5% (n=48) in those younger than 80 (P=.37). Respiratory failure occurred more frequently in those aged 80 and older. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, age of 80 and older was not a predictor of hospital mortality. The median length of stay was significantly higher in those aged 80 and older than in those younger than 80 (10 days vs 7 days, P=.01). Five-year survival was 64+/-5% in those aged 80 and older, which was similar to that of the age- and sex-matched general U.S. population. Excellent results after AVR can be expected in patients aged 80 and older, with minimal increase in postoperative mortality and acceptable postoperative morbidity. Respiratory failure is the main postoperative complication in patients aged 80 and older. Recent advances in operative techniques and perioperative management have contributed to better surgical outcomes in these patients than found in historical reports.

Tracheostomy is not a risk factor for deep sternal wound infection after cardiac surgery.
Previous studies on predictors of deep sternal wound infection (DSWI) have identified either respiratory failure or tracheostomy as a risk factor for the occurrence of this complication. This study was conducted to analyze the interaction between these two variables. We hypothesize that respiratory failure and not tracheostomy per se is associated with an increased risk of DSWI. We analyzed 2823 patients who underwent cardiac operations through median sternotomy between January 2002 and September 2006. Patients were divided into three groups: respiratory failure with or without tracheostomy (tracheostomy versus nontracheostomy) and patients without respiratory failure. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of DSWI in each group and its predictors. Postoperative respiratory failure was observed in 252 patients (9%): 144 without tracheostomy (57%) and 108 with tracheostomy (43%). The mean duration of intubation in nontracheostomy patients was 19 +/- 12 days. The mean duration to tracheostomy was 13 +/- 6 days. DSWI occurred in 38 patients (1.3%): patients with no respiratory failure, 1%; patients with respiratory failure, 5.1% (p < 0.001). The incidence of DSWI was similar between tracheostomy (4.6%) and nontracheostomy patients (5.6%, p = 0.5). The mean time to diagnosis of DSWI was 25 +/- 14 days and was similar for all groups. The mean number of days to tracheostomy was 12 +/- 3 days in DSWI patients and 13 +/- 6 in patients without DSWI (p = 0.7). In multivariate analysis, respiratory failure was the strongest predictor of DSWI (odds ratio, 5.2). Tracheostomy was not identified as a predictor of DSWI or hospital mortality. The incidence of DSWI remains high in patients with respiratory failure. Tracheostomy is not a risk factor for DSWI and serves as a surrogate for respiratory failure. Therefore, considering that early tracheostomy may be beneficial in patients with respiratory insufficiency, a more liberal approach to early tracheostomy may be warranted.

Impact of body mass index on early outcome and late survival in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting or valve surgery or both.
The influence of body mass on outcome after cardiac surgery remains controversial. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of body mass index (BMI) on early and late outcomes in a large series of patients who underwent cardiac surgery. We retrospectively analyzed 5,950 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery between January 1998 and September 2006. Patients were divided into 4 groups defined by BMI (weight divided by square of height [kilograms divided by meters squared]): underweight (<or=20 kg/m2): 6%, n=328; normal (>20 to <or=25 kg/m2): 34%, n=2,041; overweight (>25 to <or=30 kg/m2): 38%, n=2,289; obese (>30 kg/m2): 22%, n=1,292. Analysis was further refined by performing subgroup analysis according to the surgical procedure (valve surgery, coronary artery bypass grafting, and combined valve/coronary artery bypass grafting). Main outcome measure was the association between BMI and hospital mortality, postoperative morbidities, and late survival. Hospital mortality was 3.4% (n=203). There was no association between BMI and hospital mortality in the entire patient population. Multivariate analysis revealed obesity as an independent predictor of hospital mortality in patients who underwent valve surgery (odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 4.5, p=0.018). Obesity was associated with an increased risk for sternal infection (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.9, p=0.013), whereas underweight correlated with postoperative bleeding (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.6, p=0.017). Underweight was an independent predictor for decreased long-term survival (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.5, p<0.001). In conclusion, cardiac surgery can be performed safely in both underweight and obese patients but carries a higher postoperative rate of major complications.

Early and late outcomes of cardiac surgery in patients with moderate to severe preoperative renal dysfunction without dialysis.
It is well known that end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis negatively impacts early and late outcome of cardiac surgery. However, data with respect to non-dialysis-dependent renal failure patients (NDRF) are limited. We retrospectively analyzed 6940 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery from January 1998 to September 2006. Patients undergoing cardiac transplantation and ventricular assist device implantation (n=246) and dialysis dependent patients (n=245) were excluded. NDRF was present in 135 (2.1%) patients (mean age 64+/-14, 38% female). NRDF patients were more likely to present with cardiac related risk factors including ejection fraction <30% (P<0.001), prior myocardial infarction (P<0.001), congestive heart failure (P<0.001), active endocarditis (P<0.001) and hemodynamic instability (P<0.001). The estimated odds (OR) of hospital mortality in NDRF patients was 6.6 (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis retained NDRF as an independent factor for increasing the risk of hospital mortality among patients undergoing cardiac surgery (OR=5.1, P<0.001). Patients with NDRF were more likely to experience major postoperative complications when compared to the control group. One- and 5-year survival in NDRF patients was 82+/-4% and 63+/-6%, respectively, and significantly reduced compared to the control group. NDRF is a strong independent predictor of hospital mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Preoperative renal dysfunction also adversely affects long-term survival in these patients.

Excellent results of contemporary coronary artery bypass grafting with systematic application of modern perioperative strategies.
The patient population referred for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has become more challenging. The surgical population is aging and patients present with significant preoperative comorbidities. This worsening risk profile has led to the development of operative techniques (off-pump CABG) and perioperative measures (epi-aortic scanning, intensive insulin therapy) to preserve the quality of care following CABG. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of contemporary CABG following the implementation of the above measures in our practice. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data of 2725 patients undergoing CABG between 01/1998 and 12/2005 (mean age, 65 +/- 11 years; 843 [31%] female; mean ejection fraction, 45% +/- 14%). Outcome measures included hospital mortality, postoperative complications, and long-term survival and independent predictors of outcome. Subgroup analyses were performed for 2 study periods (1998-2002 versus 2003-2005) where the above measures were implemented and for patients undergoing conventional versus off-pump CABG. When comparing the 2 study periods, we observed a substantial worsening of the risk profile with an increased EuroSCORE predicted mortality from 6.4% +/- 6.8% to 7.0% +/- 7.8% (P = .028). During the same period, operative mortality decreased from 2.4% to 0.7% (P < .001). This reduction in mortality was also observed in diabetic patients (3.1% versus 1.0%, P = .021) and those with low ejection fraction (4% versus 2.6%, P = not significant). Off-pump procedures were performed with an increasing frequency in high-risk patients in whom we obtained excellent results. Finally, we observed a reduction of postoperative complications including respiratory failure (P = .013), gastrointestinal complications (P = .017), and stroke (P = .094). Independent predictors of mortality included renal failure (OR = 5.7), peripheral vascular disease (OR = 2.9), intra-aortic balloon pump (OR = 4.8), reoperation (OR = 3.3), and hypertension (OR = 2.3). Despite a worsening case mix, contemporary CABG can be performed with excellent results (operative mortality < 1%). Off-pump CABG performed in very high-risk patients obtains results similar to those of the general CABG population. Diabetes and ejection fraction were not independent predictors of early outcome. In our experience, these excellent outcomes were achieved by adopting an operative approach using modern perioperative management (epi-aortic scanning, intensive insulin therapy) and surgical techniques (off-pump CABG) based on individual patients.

Results and predictors of early and late outcome of coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with severely depressed left ventricular function.
Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a well-accepted therapeutic approach in patients with symptomatic multivessel coronary artery disease and severely depressed left ventricular function. However, the potential impact of off-pump CABG in this group of patients remains unknown. In addition, there are only scarce data regarding long-term survival and its predictors in this patient population. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data of 2,725 consecutive patients (mean age, 65 +/- 11 years; 843 (31%) female) undergoing CABG between January 1998 and December 2005 (ejection fraction [EF] < or = 0.30; n = 495, 18%). Outcome measures included hospital mortality, major complications, and long-term survival. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of hospital mortality and late survival. Subgroup analysis for patients with EF less than or equal to 0.30 undergoing conventional CABG (n = 424, 86%) versus off-pump CABG (n = 71, 14%) was performed. Hospital mortality was 1.8% (EF < or = 0.30, 3.6%; EF > 0.30, 1.4%; p = 0.002). Off-pump CABG did not have an impact on operative mortality (on-pump, 4%; off-pump, 3%; p = 0.509). Ejection fraction of 0.30 or less was not an independent risk factor of hospital mortality but predicted respiratory failure (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3) and sepsis (OR, 1.4). Long-term survival was significantly decreased in patients with EF of 0.30 or less: 1-year and 5-year survival 88% +/- 1.5% and 75% +/- 2.2% versus 96% +/- 0.4% and 81% +/- 1.2%, respectively (p = 0.001). Reoperation (OR, 6.9), peripheral vascular disease (OR, 3.2), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 3.0), congestive heart failure (OR, 2.7), and female sex (OR, 2.1) were independent predictors of long-term survival. Excellent results after CABG can be expected in patients with EF of 0.30 or less, with minimal increase in mortality and acceptable postoperative morbidity. Long-term survival remains limited, but recent results are substantially better than historical reports. Careful preoperative patient selection and perioperative management are essential in these patients undergoing CABG.
