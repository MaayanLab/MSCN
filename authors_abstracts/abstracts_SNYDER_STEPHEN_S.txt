Sexual evaluation and treatment of ageing males with haemophilia.
Summary.? Sexual dysfunction is common in ageing men and may be exacerbated by the special medical issues and psychological problems associated with haemophilia. Sexual healthcare for men with haemophilia (MWH) requires a background understanding of common patterns of sexual function and dysfunction in the ageing male, expectable sexual complications of haemophilia and related comorbidities, and of sexually related psychological issues. Healthcare providers who treat MWH must be able to elicit a sexual history sufficient to differentiate problems involving a loss of sexual desire from ejaculatory difficulties and erectile dysfunction (ED). Other necessary skills include evaluating patients with ED for treatable causes, distinguishing organic from psychogenic ED, using phosphodieterase-5 inhibitors as first-line treatment for ED, and referring to specialized sexual urology and mental health professionals when appropriate.
