Predictors and outcomes of seizures after cardiac surgery: a multivariable analysis of 2,578 patients.
Limited data exist regarding the epidemiology and prognosis of seizures in adults after cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to define preoperative predictors of seizures and impact on postoperative outcomes. A prospective database of 2,578 consecutive adults who underwent cardiac surgery at a single institution between April 2007 and December 2009 was retrospectively analyzed to determine risk factors for postoperative seizures and prognostic impact. No patient received tranexamic acid or aprotinin. Seizures occurred in 31 patients (1%) at a median of 2 days postoperatively (1 patient had a preoperative diagnosis of seizure disorder). Seizures were classified as generalized tonic-clonic (71%), simple/complex partial (26%), or status epilepticus (3%). Incidence differed according to procedure (coronary bypass 0.1%, isolated valve 1%, valve/coronary bypass 3%, aorta 5%; p <0.001). Patients who experienced seizures had nearly a fivefold higher operative mortality than patients who did not (29% versus 6%, p <0.001). Head computed tomography was performed in 26 patients (84%), of whom ischemic strokes were identified in 14 cases (53%). These were embolic in 9 patients (34%), and watershed in 3 (12%). Hemorrhagic strokes were observed in 2 patients (8%). The occurrence of a new postoperative stroke in seizure patients did not significantly increase the likelihood of in-hospital death. Thirteen patients (41%) were discharged without neurologic deficit. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified three risk factors for seizure: deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, aortic calcification or atheroma, and critical preoperative state. Seizures in adults after cardiac surgery are strong independent predictors of permanent neurologic deficit and increased operative mortality. Early head computed tomography may be indicated to identify treatable pathology.

Prosthetic valve selection for middle-aged patients with aortic stenosis.
Choosing the optimal aortic valve prosthesis for middle-aged patients (late 40s to early 60s) with aortic stenosis presents a challenge. The available options all have substantial drawbacks that must be considered in the decision-making process. Current data indicate that there is little or no difference in survival between mechanical and bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement in middle-aged patients at 10-15 years after surgery. Patients who receive a mechanical valve replacement have an annual risk of major hemorrhagic or embolic events of 2-4% per year for life compared with about 1% per year for patients who have a bioprosthetic valve. However, bioprostheses are associated with an increasing risk of structural valve degeneration from 10 years postimplantation, and most patients will require reoperation if they survive much longer than a decade. The mortality risk associated with reoperation is similar to that of primary surgery for most patients, and does not seem to impact on the 15-year survival in this patient group. The Ross procedure, in which the aortic valve is replaced with a pulmonary autograft, can provide improved freedom from morbidity, but operative mortality is probably double that of isolated aortic valve replacement and most patients will require reoperation. Informed patient choice is the most important factor in deciding which valve to use, with biological valves increasingly favored over mechanical valves in middle-aged patients.

A propensity score-adjusted retrospective comparison of early and mid-term results of mitral valve repair versus replacement in octogenarians.
Feasibility and efficacy of mitral repair in the elderly remain controversial. This study aims to compare outcomes of mitral repair and replacement in octogenarians. We compared the outcomes of 322 consecutive octogenarian patients (mean age 82.6 ± 2.2 years) who underwent mitral repair (n = 227, 70%) or replacement (n = 95, 30%) at Mount Sinai Medical Center and Leipzig Herzzentrum between 1998 and 2008 using propensity score adjustment and univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients undergoing aortic valve replacement were excluded. Coronary bypass was performed in 47.5% (n = 153), and 31.1% (n = 100) required tricuspid repair. Propensity score adjustment yielded comparable groups. Thirty-day mortality in patients undergoing primary elective mitral repair for degenerative disease was 5.1% (2/39). Overall 90-day mortality was 18.9% (43/227) for repair compared with 31.6% (30/95) for replacement (P = 0.014). Pre-discharge echocardiography revealed less than moderate residual regurgitation in 99% of patients (231/232). Adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival for patients undergoing mitral repair was 71 ± 3, 61 ± 4, and 59 ± 4%, respectively, compared with 56 ± 5, 50 ± 6, and 45 ± 6% for patients undergoing mitral replacement (P = 0.046). Multivariate analysis demonstrated emergency surgery, previous myocardial infarction, concomitant coronary artery bypass surgery, and mitral replacement to be strong independent predictors of early mortality; mitral valve replacement was an independent predictor of reduced survival in degenerative patients. Elective mitral repair can be performed with low operative mortality and good long-term outcomes in selected octogenarians with degenerative mitral disease, and is associated with better long-term survival than mitral replacement. The survival benefit associated with surgery for non-degenerative disease is more questionable.

The impact of moderate-to-end-stage renal failure on outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
Currently, established renal failure is a well-recognized risk factor for operative mortality in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The authors aimed to establish the relative impact of dialysis-dependent renal failure (DRF) and nondialysis-dependent renal failure (NDRF) on early and late outcome after CABG surgery. A retrospective cohort study. A single teaching hospital. The authors analyzed prospectively collected data from 2,960 adult patients who underwent isolated CABG surgery between 1998 and 2006 at the authors' institution, according to whether they had preoperative NDRF based on preoperative creatinine >2.5 mg/dL, DRF, or neither (controls). CABG surgery. Outcome measures included hospital mortality, postoperative complications, length of stay, and survival. Hospital mortality was 1.8% (n = 52). Patients in the NDRF and DRF groups had a significantly increased mortality (8.3%, n = 13) compared with the control group (1.4%, n = 39), and both NDRF (odds ratio [OR] = 6.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.3-16.5; p < 0.001) and DRF (OR = 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-10.0; p = 0.004) were found to be independent predictors of operative mortality. The overall mean follow-up was 3.9 +/- 2.5 years. Multivariate analysis revealed DRF (OR = 5.1) to be an independent predictor of late mortality after cardiac surgery, whereas NDRF was not found to be an independent predictor of late mortality. Preoperative renal failure is an independent risk factor for adverse early and late outcomes after CABG surgery. NDRF is associated with increased hospital mortality and major morbidity compared with patients with lesser degrees of renal dysfunction, but also compared with DRF patients.

Management of anomalous left circumflex artery encircling the aortic annulus in a patient undergoing multivalvular surgery.
The abnormal origin of left circumflex artery from the right sinus of Valsalva with a retroaortic course is a well-known coronary anomaly usually without consequences. In patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, this finding becomes crucial because the left circumflex is at risk of injury during the procedure. The scenario is even more complex in patients undergoing multi-valve surgery. We report the diagnosis and successful operative strategy in a patient with anomalous left circumflex arising from the proximal right sinus of Valsalva undergoing double aortic and tricuspid valve surgery for active bacterial endocarditis.

Comparison of the results of aortic valve replacement with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < or =30% versus patients with ejection fraction >30%.
The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that low-ejection fraction (EF), low-gradient aortic stenosis (AS) is a predictor of major morbidity after aortic valve replacement (AVR). We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from 597 consecutive patients with AS (mean age 72 +/- 11 years) who had undergone AVR or combined AVR and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) from 1998 to 2006 (EF < or =30% in 73 [12%]). The outcome measures included hospital mortality, major complications, and long-term survival. The overall hospital mortality rate was 4% (low-EF AS 5%; low-EF AS plus CABG 8%; AS controls 4%; AS plus CABG controls 3%; p = 0.42). Low-EF, low-gradient AS was not an independent risk factor for hospital mortality but predicted stroke (odds ratio [OR] 4.3), deep sternal wound infection (OR 10.0), sepsis (OR 6.8), gastrointestinal complications (OR 4.2), and respiratory failure (OR 4.4). The survival rate at 1, 3, and 5 years was 69 +/- 8%, 69 +/- 8%, and 65 +/- 8% in the low-EF, low-gradient, AVR plus CABG group and 95 +/- 4%, 92 +/- 5%, and 82 +/- 7% in the low-EF, low-gradient AVR group compared to 93 +/- 2%, 88 +/- 2%, and 78 +/- 3% in the AVR plus CABG control group and 93 +/- 2%, 89 +/- 2%, and 85 +/- 3% in the AVR control group (p = 0.001), respectively. In the patients with low-EF AS who experienced major postoperative morbidity, the 1-year survival rate was significantly reduced (54 +/- 14%) compared to those who did not (95 +/- 3%, p <0.001). In conclusion, low-EF, low-gradient AS is a predictor of increased major morbidity after AVR, which nonetheless remains the treatment of choice for most patients because of the excellent early and late survival. However, patients with strong risk factors for postoperative renal and respiratory failure might derive less benefit from conventional surgical AVR.

Current concepts in ablation of atrial fibrillation.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in clinical practice. It occurs particularly frequently in cardiac surgical patients and is associated with significant excess mortality and morbidity. Pharmacological management of AF is relatively ineffective and associated with significant side effects and complications. Clinicians have therefore pursued more definitive treatment options, both catheter based and surgical, to treat patients with AF. Surgical techniques designed to cure AF have developed in parallel with an improved understanding of the pathophysiological processes underlying this condition. This review describes the rationale behind current surgical approaches to AF and summarizes the results achieved with current techniques.

Epidemiology of deep sternal wound infection in cardiac surgery.
The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and predictors of deep sternal wound infection (DSWI) in a contemporary cohort of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The early and late outcomes of patients with this complication also were analyzed. A retrospective study of consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery using a computerized database based on the New York State Department of Health registry. Data collection was performed prospectively. A university hospital (single institution). Five thousand seven hundred ninety-eight patients who underwent cardiac surgery between January 1998 and December 2005 including isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) (n = 2,749, 47%), single- or multiple-valve surgery (n = 1,280, 22%), combined valve and CABG procedures (n = 934, 16%), and surgery involving the ascending aorta or the aortic arch (n = 835, 15%). None. The overall incidence of DSWI was 1.8% (n = 106). The highest rate of DSWI occurred after combined valve/CABG surgery (2.4%, n = 22) and aortic procedures (2.4%, n = 19). Multivariate analysis revealed 11 predictors of DSWI: obesity (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2), previous myocardial infarction (OR = 2.1), diabetes (OR = 1.7), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 2.3), preoperative length of stay >3 days (OR = 1.9), aortic calcification (OR = 2.7), aortic surgery (OR = 2.4), combined valve/CABG procedures (OR = 1.9), cardiopulmonary bypass time (OR = 1.8), re-exploration for bleeding (OR = 6.3), and respiratory failure (OR = 3.2). The mortality rate was 14.2% (n = 15) versus 3.6% (n = 205) in the control group (p < 0.001). One- and 5-year survival after DSWI were significantly decreased (72.4% +/- 4.4% and 55.8% +/- 5.6% v 93.8% +/- 0.3% and 82.0% +/- 0.6%, p < 0.001). DSWI remains a rare but devastating complication and is associated with significant comorbidity, increased hospital mortality, and reduced long-term survival.

Predicting postoperative renal failure requiring dialysis, and an analysis of long-term outcome in patients undergoing valve surgery.
Previous studies have been unable to identify independent valve-related risk factors for the occurrence of renal failure requiring dialysis (RF-D) in patients undergoing valve surgery. The study aim was to determine the incidence and predictors of renal failure in these patients, and to create a model based on these risk factors that could serve as a tool to predict this complication. Between January 1998 and December 2006, a total of 2,690 consecutive patients (1,546 males, 1,144 females; mean age 64 +/- 15 years) underwent valve or combined valve/coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery at the authors' institution. The main outcome investigated was postoperative RF-D; other postoperative parameters investigated included hospital mortality, major morbidity, length of hospital stay, discharge condition and late survival. RF-D occurred in 70 patients (2.6%). Multivariate analysis revealed preoperative renal failure (creatinine >2.5 mg/dl) (OR = 4.3), endocarditis (OR = 3.0), congestive heart failure (OR = 2.4), reoperation (OR = 2.3), diabetes (OR = 3.1) and cardiopulmonary bypass time >180 min (OR = 1.7) as independent predictors for postoperative RF-D. Hospital mortality among patients with RF-D was 50% (n = 35) compared to a mortality rate of 3.2% (n = 87) in patients without this complication (p <0.001). The long-term survival of discharged patients with RF-D was significantly decreased compared to those without RF-D. A logistic equation which included the coefficients of the regression analysis was generated to calculate an individual patient's risk for the development of renal failure. The predictive accuracy of the model and validation was measured (ROC area under the curve = 0.750). Renal failure requiring dialysis is a well-known complication, particularly in patients undergoing complex valve operations, such as surgery for endocarditis and double-valve procedures. The poor long-term survival of patients with RF-D underlines the need to direct more resources towards the prevention and treatment of this complication in valve surgery patients.

Results and predictors of early and late outcome of coronary artery bypass graft surgery in patients with ejection fraction less than 20%.
Severely depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF</=20%) has historically been a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality in medically and surgically managed coronary artery disease. Recent studies have suggested that outcomes in patients with EF less or equal to 20% undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery are improving, but the trend in the outcomes remains unclear. We retrospectively analysed prospectively collected data from 2909 consecutive patients undergoing isolated CABG between January 1998 and August 2006. One hundred and eighty five patients (6.4%) had an ejection fraction less or equal to 20%. Primary outcome measures for this study included hospital mortality, major postoperative complications, and long-term survival. The median age in the overall patient population was 65 years (interquartile range 58-73) and 69% (n=2015) of patients were male. The overall hospital mortality among our study population was 2.3% (n=67). The mortality among patients with EF less or equal to 20 was 5% (n=11) compared to 2% (n=56) in patients with EF above 20% (p=0.001). The proportion of patients with a high EuroSCORE (>9%) was significantly greater in the group with EF less or equal to 20% (49%) than in the group with EF above 20% (20%). EF less or equal to 20% was not shown by multivariable logistic regression analysis to be an independent predictor of operative mortality. Survival rates at one year were 85+/-2.8%, 93+/-0.9%, and 98%+/-0.3% for patients with EF less or equal to 20%, over 20-40% and greater than 40% respectively; and at five years: 72+/-0.4%, 81+/-0.2% and 89+/-0.1%, respectively (p<0.001). We demonstrate acceptable mortality rates in patients with an EF less or equal to 20%, and show that EF less or equal to 20% does not appear to be an independent predictor of hospital mortality in our practice. Incremental changes in practice including improved patient selection and peroperative management may have reduced the impact of EF less or equal to 20% on mortality following CABG.

Logistic risk model predicting postoperative respiratory failure in patients undergoing valve surgery.
Previous studies have been unable to identify independent valve-related risk factors for postoperative respiratory failure (RF) in patients undergoing valve surgery. This study was designed to determine the incidence and predictors of RF in these patients. We also aimed to create a model based on these risk factors that could serve as a tool for the prediction of this complication. We analyzed prospectively collected data of 2808 patients (mean age 63+/-15 years, 43% female) who underwent valve surgery from January 1998 to December 2006. Isolated valve surgery was performed in 2007 (72%) patients whereas 801 (28%) received concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures. The main outcome investigated was RF (ventilation >72 h). Other postoperative parameters included in the analysis were hospital mortality, morbidity, length of hospital stay, discharge and late survival. Respiratory failure occurred in 12.2% (n=342) of patients. The incidence of RF varied according to the procedures (single valve: 7.4-15.8%; multiple valves: 21.7-23.4%). The addition of CABG significantly increased the rate of RF (isolated valves: 10.8%, combined valve/CABG 15.7%, p<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed preoperative renal failure, ejection fraction <30%, age >70 years, active endocarditis, emergent procedures, reoperation, diabetes, congestive heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, female gender, double aortic and mitral valve procedures, and cardiopulmonary bypass time >180 min as independent predictors of RF. Hospital mortality among patients with RF was 22.2% (n=76) versus 2.7% (n=66) in the control group (p<0.001). A logistic equation including the coefficients of the regression analysis was generated to calculate an individual patient's risk for the development of RF. Predictive accuracy of the model and validation was measured (ROC area under the curve: 0.751). Long-term survival of discharged patients with RF was significantly decreased compared to those without RF. Respiratory failure is a common complication particularly in patients undergoing complex valve operations such as endocarditis or multiple valve procedures. The independent predictors of RF including valve-related factors allowed us to create a predictive model with great accuracy. The poor long-term survival of patients with RF underlines the need to direct more resources towards prevention and treatment of this complication.

Excellent results of cardiac surgery in patients with previous kidney transplantation.
Patients with a kidney allograft are at high risk for the development of cardiovascular diseases that may require surgical intervention. Little is known about the outcome of cardiac surgery in these patients. A retrospective study. A university hospital (single institution). Twenty-nine patients with a kidney allograft who underwent cardiac surgery between January 1998 and December 2006. None. Main outcome measures were hospital mortality, postoperative complications, allograft function, and late survival. Twenty-nine patients (mean age, 53 +/- 14 years; 18 (62%) male; 22 preserved allograft function, 2 acute failure, and 5 chronic failure) were identified. Hospital mortality was 3.4% (n = 1). Temporary allograft dysfunction determined by a >30% increase of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen was noticed in 5 (23%) patients with preserved allograft and recovered before discharge. Two patients required postoperative dialysis (1 temporary and 1 permanent). Six (21%) other major complications occurred and included respiratory failure (n = 4, 14%) and sepsis (n = 2, 7%). One- and 5-year survival was 89% +/- 6% and 50% +/- 14%, respectively. Four of 9 patients who died during follow-up had chronic allograft failure. Cardiac surgery can be performed safely in kidney transplant recipients with low mortality and acceptable morbidities. Allograft dysfunction is a common finding, but it is transient with early functional recovery. Late survival of kidney recipients with chronic allograft failure undergoing cardiac procedures is limited when compared with that of the general cardiac surgery population. The present data suggest that these patients should be considered for cardiac surgery in reference centers with expertise in complex cardiac procedures and perioperative management of these highly specific patients.

B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery.
Plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level may be increased in patients with valvular disease. Recent studies have suggested that in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, an increased preoperative BNP is associated with a worse operative outcome. Little is known about the perioperative value of BNP in patients undergoing mitral valve (MV) surgery. We measured the preoperative and postoperative BNP levels in this population and analyzed the impact of the increased BNP level on surgical outcome. From March 2004 to February 2005, 42 patients (mean age 64 +/- 12 years, 18 [42%] male) were enrolled in a prospective study. All patients underwent surgery for severe mitral regurgitation. The mean ejection fraction was 49 +/- 13%, and 26 (62%) patients presented with atrial fibrillation (AF). The median preoperative and postoperative BNP levels were 108 (9.7 to 995) and 357 (143 to 904) pg/mL, respectively (p = 0.002). Heart failure (p = 0.03), atrial fibrillation (AF) (p = 0.01), and ejection fraction (p = 0.01) were associated with an increased preoperative BNP level. In a multivariate analysis, the only independent predictor of the increased BNP level was AF (p = 0.01). In a univariate analysis, the preoperative BNP level was a significant predictor for inotropic support (p < 0.001), ventilation time (p = 0.003), intensive care unit (ICU; p = 0.01), and hospital length of stay (p = 0.02). In the multivariate analysis, BNP was not a predictor of these variables. Preoperative plasma BNP level presents with a high individual variability in patients with MV regurgitation. AF was the only independent predictor of an increased preoperative BNP level. The preoperative BNP level was not a predictor of surgical outcome. Further studies are required to confirm these findings and evaluate the potential role of this marker for patient selection.

Epicardial pulmonary vein isolation: a long-term histologic and imaging animal study comparing cryothermy versus radiofrequency.
Simplifications of the Cox-Maze procedure to treat atrial fibrillation (AF) include epicardial pulmonary vein (PV) isolation using various sources to create lines of conduction block. The creation of transmural lesions has been a concern. The heat-sink effect caused by blood flow has limited the effectiveness of unipolar radiofrequency and linear application of cryothermy, which should be abolished when clamp devices are used for PV isolation. The efficacy and safety of epicardial beating-heart PV isolation with clamp devices using cryothermy or bipolar radiofrequency energy was studied. Twelve domestic pigs underwent beating-heart epicardial PV isolation using cryothermy (n = 6) or radiofrequency (n = 6) energy. Follow-up was 30 days for 3 animals of each group and 90 days for the others. Lesions were assessed by epicardial pacing, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and histologic analysis. Immediate and long-term electrical isolation of PVs was achieved with both energy sources. Histologic analysis showed transmural lesions in all animals at 30 and 90 days. Cardiac MRI showed no evidence of PV stenosis or thrombus formation. Mean left atrial ejection fraction was 0.36 +/- 0.01, 0.36 +/- 0.02, and 0.36 +/- 0.01 at baseline and at 30 and 90 days, respectively (p = 0.360 and 0.230, respectively) and not significantly different with cryothermy or radiofrequency ablations. Beating-heart PV isolation using epicardial cryothermy or radiofrequency ablation produces transmural lesions with complete electrical conduction block, with low or no risk of endocardial thrombosis or PV stenosis. This approach may be useful for PVI in selected patients with AF caused by PV triggers.

Surgical left atrial appendage occlusion: evaluation of a novel device with magnetic resonance imaging.
Management of the left atrial appendage (LAA) is considered an important adjunct to ablation in cardiac surgical patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, current surgical techniques, both cut-and-sew and stapling, have been associated with incomplete LAA occlusion and complications. Using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we studied the safety and effectiveness of a new device for LAA occlusion in a primate model. Seven adult baboons underwent off-pump placement of an LAA clip (AtriCure Inc., Westchester, Ohio). LAA occlusion was confirmed intraoperatively by direct incision. All animals had MRI before and after clip placement to assess LAA perfusion, architecture, and overall cardiac function. Pathologic and histological studies were performed at 7, 30 and 180 days. Clip placement was successful in all (n=7) without any clip related complications. Complete LAA occlusion was demonstrated intraoperatively in all subjects. LAA occlusion was confirmed on pre-sacrifice MRI, and left and right ventricular function were unchanged from preoperative studies; however, clip placement caused small reductions in left ventricular end-diastolic, end-systolic, and stroke volumes. At sacrifice, direct inspection confirmed stable location, persistent LAA exclusion, tissue in-growth and homogenous epithelialization without damage to adjacent structures. Histological analysis revealed a regular in-growth pattern in all studied specimens. We demonstrated a safe, straightforward, persistent and effective method for LAA occlusion with this new LAA clip. MRI effectively demonstrated LAA occlusion and only minor changes in left ventricular volumes.

Predictors and early and late outcomes of dialysis-dependent patients in contemporary cardiac surgery.
The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence and predictors of renal failure requiring dialysis (RF-D) in a contemporary cohort of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The authors also analyzed early and late outcome of patients with this complication. A retrospective study of consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery using a computerized database based on the New York State Department of Health registry. Data collection was performed prospectively. A university hospital (single institution). Six thousand four hundred forty-nine patients who underwent cardiac surgery between January 1998 and December 2006 including isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (n = 2,819, 44%), single- or multiple-valve surgery (n = 1,378, 21%), combined valve and CABG procedures (n = 1,032, 16%), and surgery involving the ascending aorta or the aortic arch (n = 1,220, 19%). None. The incidence of RF-D was 2.2% (n = 139). The incidence per type of procedure was as follows: CABG surgery (0.8%), valve/CABG surgery (2.7%), valve surgery (2.9%), and aortic surgery (4%) (p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed preoperative renal dysfunction (odds ratio [OR] = 5.5), hemodynamic instability (OR = 5.2), diabetes (OR = 2.6), aortic surgery (OR = 2.2), congestive heart failure (CHF) (OR = 2.1), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (OR = 1.9), and reoperation (OR = 1.8) as independent predictors of RF-D. The hospital mortality after RF-D was 36.7% (n = 51) compared with 2.9% (n = 180) in the control group (p < 0.001). Long-term survival after RF-D was significantly decreased (1-year and 5-year survival 48.5% +/- 6.1% and 28.7% +/- 7.2% v 94.5% +/- 0.3% and 83.5% +/- 0.6% in the control group, p < 0.001). Hypertension, CHF, and PVD were independent predictors of late mortality. The authors observed an increase in the overall incidence of RF-D compared with previous studies, probably related to an increased prevalence of patients undergoing more complex procedures with a worsening risk profile. Postoperative RF-D was not only associated with increased hospital mortality and morbidity, but also with a significant reduction of long-term survival in discharged patients. Seven independent predictors of RF-D were identified. Future research efforts should focus on a more precise identification of patients at risk and the development of new treatment modalities, which would potentially prevent the occurrence of this complication.

Surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation using cryothermy in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery.
Surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) using a variety of energy sources and a mixture of lesion sets has become an important adjunct in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data of 141 patients with a history of AF (mean duration of AF 35+/-39 months; intermittent AF: n=72; 51%; permanent AF: 69 (49%)) who underwent a left-sided Cryomaze procedure in conjunction with mitral valve (MV) surgery between January 2003 and September 2006. Freedom from AF was 77% at discharge and 87% at a mean follow-up of 305+/-195 days with a decreasing rate of AF during the first 3-9 months from 13% to 9% and an increase beyond the first year (29% at 2 years). Predictors of failed Cryomaze in multivariate analysis were left atrial size >50 mm (OR=5.7), AF at surgery (OR=5.0) and cardiac reoperation (OR=3.4), whereas preoperative beta-blocker treatment was a predictor of success (OR=0.2). Our data suggest that a left-sided Cryomaze procedure effectively restores sinus rhythm in patients with AF undergoing MV surgery. The success rate should not be evaluated immediately postoperatively because there is a steady increase in the rate of patients with freedom from AF in the first year. It appears, however, that there is a higher rate of recurrence during later follow-up.

Prosthesis type has minimal impact on survival after valve surgery in patients with moderate to end-stage renal failure.
Few previous studies have reported on the outcome of patients with renal failure (RF) undergoing valvular surgery, particularly with regard to choice of valve prosthesis. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from 155 patients with RF (mean age 62 +/- 14, 42% female) who underwent left-sided valve surgery from January 1998 to December 2006. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (non-dialysis-dependent renal failure (NDRF); creatinine >2.5 mg/dl; n = 47, 40%) and Group 2 (renal failure dialysis (DRF); n = 108, 60%). Mechanical valves were implanted in 50 (32%) patients and bioprostheses in 63 (41%). Isolated mitral valve reconstruction was performed in 27% (n = 42) of patients. Outcome measures included hospital mortality, major postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, discharge planning and late survival. The overall hospital mortality was 19.3% (n = 30) and was not different between Groups 1 (23%) and 2 (18%). Ejection fraction, peripheral vascular disease, aortic valve replacement and reoperation were independent predictors of hospital mortality. One- and five-year survival rates were 74.4 +/- 7.8% and 53.1 +/- 10.1% in Group 1 and 75.8 +/- 4.6% and 49.1 +/- 7.1% in Group 2 (P = ns), respectively. According to the type of prostheses, hospital mortality and freedom from reoperation were similar in patients with mechanical and biological valves. Five-year survival rate was 51 +/- 10.7 for biological valves versus 55 +/- 8.4 for mechanical valves (P = ns). Hospital mortality and morbidity remain high in patients with RF undergoing valvular surgery and it is not different in NDRF and DRF patients. This study suggests that the type of valve prosthesis does not appear to have an impact on early and late survival but is limited by sample size. It may be that bioprostheses should be more widely used in patients with RF requiring valve replacement.

Incidence, imaging analysis, and early and late outcomes of stroke after cardiac valve operation.
The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence, topography, and mechanisms of stroke, independent predictors, and late outcome after cardiac valve operations. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from 2,808 patients (mean age 63 +/- 15 years, n = 1,610, 55% men) who underwent valve surgery with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting from January 1998 to December 2006. Stroke was defined as any new permanent focal neurologic deficit. Overall incidence of stroke was 2.2% (n = 63) and decreased during the study period from 3.3% (1998 to 2002) to 1.3% (2003 to 2006; p = 0.001). The highest stroke rate was observed after double aortic/mitral valve replacement (5.4%) and valve/coronary artery bypass grafting procedures (3.6%). Brain imaging was positive in 74% (n = 43 of 58) and showed ischemic stroke in all patients and hemorrhagic conversion in 28%. Distribution of acute stroke was large territory embolic artery (n = 33, 77%), watershed (n = 7, 16%), and mixed pattern (n = 3, 7%). Multivariate analysis revealed calcified ascending aorta (odds ratio [OR] 2.7), female gender (OR 2.6), ejection fraction <30% (OR 2.3), diabetes (OR 2.2), age >70 years (OR 2.0), and cardiopulmonary bypass time >120 minutes (OR 3.7) as predictors of stroke. Hospital mortality was 24% and 4.6% in patients with and without stroke, respectively. Survival of stroke patients was 78% and 54% at 1 year and 5 years, respectively, and was significantly decreased compared with patients without stroke. Valve pathology including endocarditis did not influence the incidence of stroke. Intraoperative epiaortic scanning may contribute in decreasing the incidence of this complication and may be warranted in all patients undergoing valvular surgery. In conclusion, stroke after valvular surgery is associated with an increased hospital mortality and morbidity and decreased long-term survival.

[Cardiovascular surgery in patients with HIV: epidemiology, current indications, and long-term outcome].
The new highly active antiretroviral therapies used for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have dramatically modified the natural history of the disease. Although these therapies may themselves have adverse cardiovascular side-effects, their use has also resulted in seropositive patients surviving long enough to be exposed to the same risk factors as the general population. As a consequence, referrals for cardiovascular surgery have increased. We carried out a retrospective analysis of 39 consecutive HIV patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery between January 1998 and December 2006. The patients' mean age was 49+/-10 years and 77% (n=30) were male. The CD4-lymphocyte count was <500 cells/microl in 56% of patients (n=22). The main indications for surgery were endocarditis (n=18, 46%), coronary artery disease (n=12, 31%), and aortic disease (n=5, 13%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 5% (n=2). Postoperative complications included systemic infection (n=2, 5%), stroke (n=1, 3%), kidney failure (n=1, 3%) and respiratory failure (n=5, 13%). Repeat surgery for bleeding was necessary in 2 patients (5%). There were no postoperative complications in 29 patients (72%). After a clinical follow-up period of 8.2 years, the long-term mortality rate was 10.8% (4/37), giving survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years of 91%, 86% and 81% respectively. Cardiovascular surgery can be performed with complete safety in HIV patients, and with promising results. This study indicates that, currently, long-term survival in this particular group of patients is potentially greater than 80%.

Cardiac anesthesia and surgery in geriatric patients.
The average age of US population is steadily increasing, with more than 15 million people aged 80 and older. Coronary artery disease and degenerative cardiovascular diseases are particularly prevalent in this population. Consequently, an increasing number of elderly patients are referred for surgical intervention. Advanced age is associated with decreased physiologic reserve and significant comorbidity. Thorough preoperative assessment, identification of the risk factors for perioperative morbidity and mortality, and optimal preparation are critical in these patients. Age-related changes in comorbidities and altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics impacts anesthetic management, perioperative monitoring, postoperative care, and outcome. This article updates the age-related changes in organ subsystems relevant to cardiac anesthesia, perioperative issues, and intraoperative management. Early and late operative outcome in octogenarians undergoing cardiac surgery are reviewed. The data clearly indicate that no patient group is "too old" for cardiac surgery and that excellent outcomes can be achieved in selected group of elderly patients.

Early and late outcome of cardiac surgery in dialysis-dependent patients: single-center experience with 245 consecutive patients.
Previous studies on outcome of cardiac surgery and its predictors in patients with preoperative kidney failure requiring dialysis have included small numbers of patients with limited follow-up. In addition, predictors of long-term outcome are not well characterized. This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data for 6694 patients, including 245 (3.7%) patients with end-stage kidney failure requiring dialysis who underwent cardiac surgery between January 1998 and September 2006. Potential predictors of hospital mortality, complications, and late survival were retrospectively analyzed by using multivariate regression models. Patients with end-stage kidney failure requiring dialysis had a 3.9-times higher hospital mortality rate compared with other cardiac surgery patients (12.7% vs 3.6%, P < .001). Patients with end-stage kidney failure requiring dialysis were younger but presented with more comorbidities and more severe cardiac disease than the control group. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, end-stage kidney failure requiring dialysis was identified as a predictor of hospital mortality (odds ratio, 3.1; P < .001). Patients with end-stage kidney failure requiring dialysis also had an increased risk of postoperative sepsis (odds ratio, 2.7; P < .001) and respiratory failure (odds ratio, 2.0; P < .001). Peripheral vascular disease was an independent predictor of hospital mortality in patients with end-stage kidney failure requiring dialysis (odds ratio, 2.5; P = .001). Long-term survival was significantly decreased in patients with end-stage kidney failure requiring dialysis compared with that seen in the control group (1-year and 5-year survival: 72.3% +/- 3.3% and 39.0% +/- 4.5% vs 94.2% +/- 0.3% and 83.2% +/- 0.6%, P < .001). Peripheral vascular disease (odds ratio, 2.69; P = .008) and previous stroke (odds ratio, 4.37; P < .001) were independent risk factors of late mortality in the subgroup of patients with end-stage kidney failure requiring dialysis. Preoperative renal failure requiring dialysis is associated with a significant increase in hospital mortality, postoperative sepsis, and respiratory failure in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In these patients long-term survival is particularly reduced in the presence of advanced atherosclerotic disease.

Quadruple valve surgery in carcinoid heart disease.
We describe a 42-year-old male with primary carcinoid tumor of the ileum, secondary liver metastases, and subsequent severe carcinoid heart disease with quadruple valve involvement. The patient underwent tricuspid and pulmonic bioprosthetic valve replacement, mitral and aortic valve reconstruction. Transthoracic echocardiography at 25 months showed competent mitral and aortic valves with only mild regurgitation. Valve reconstruction is rarely performed in patients with carcinoid heart disease. However, in selected cases it is a valuable alternative technique with good mid-term outcome.

Incidence, topography, predictors and long-term survival after stroke in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.
Previous studies on stroke after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) provide limited data about the timing (early vs delayed) of this event and findings of brain imaging analysis. This information is of significant importance because it provides insight into the etiology of stroke, potentially allowing the development of preventive measures. This study analyzed the incidence and timing of stroke, the topography and mechanisms of cerebral lesions, independent predictors, and late outcome after the occurrence of this complication in patients undergoing CABG. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from 2985 patients (2064 men [67%]), with a mean age of 66 +/- 11 years, who underwent CABG between January 1998 and December 2006. Stroke was defined as any new permanent focal neurologic deficit (early stroke, < or = 24 hours; delayed, > 24 hours postoperatively). The incidence of stroke was 1.6% (n = 48) and similar between conventional CABG (1.6%) and off-pump CABG (1.4%). Early stroke occurred in 25 patients (52%). Brain imaging was obtained in 44 patients (92%): 44 had computed tomography, 3 had magnetic resonance imaging. Results were positive in 33 of 44 patients (75%), showing large embolic stroke in 25 (76%), watershed in 5 (15%), and mixed pattern in 3 (9%). Chronic ischemic changes were found in 17 patients. Multivariate analysis revealed extensive aortic calcification (odds ratio [OR], 4.2), previous stroke (OR, 2.2), female sex (OR, 1.9), and congestive heart failure (OR, 2.6) as predictors of stroke. The hospital mortality rate after stroke was 16.7% (n = 8) compared with 1.5% (n = 44) in those without (p < 0.001). The mortality rate was higher in early stroke at 24% (6 of 25) compared with 9% (2 of 23) in late stroke. Survival of stroke patients was 87% at 1 year and 62% at 5 years and was significantly reduced compared with 96% and 85%, respectively, in patients without stroke (p<0.001). Most strokes after CABG occurred early after surgery. This complication is associated with an increased hospital mortality and morbidity and reduced long-term survival. The infarction type had no impact on early and late outcome. Preoperative computed tomography scan seems warranted in patients at risk and without any previous history of stroke.

Predictors and early and late outcomes of respiratory failure in contemporary cardiac surgery.
Respiratory failure (RF) is a serious complication following heart surgery. The profile of patients referred for cardiac surgery has changed during the last decade, making prior investigations of RF after cardiac surgery less relevant to the current population. This study was designed to analyze the incidence, predictors of RF, and early and late outcomes following this complication in a large contemporary cardiac surgery population. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from the New York State Department of Health database including 5,798 patients undergoing cardiac surgery between January 1998 and December 2005. Patients with RF (intubation time > or = 72 h) were compared to patients without RF. The incidence of RF was 9.1% (n = 529). The highest incidence of RF was observed following combined valve/coronary artery bypass graft (14.8%) and aortic procedures (13.5%). Multivariate analysis revealed preoperative and operative predictors of RF such as renal failure (odds ratio [OR], 2.3), aortic procedures (OR, 2.6), hemodynamic instability (OR, 3.2), and intraaortic balloon pump (OR, 2.6). The mortality rate following RF was 15.5% (n = 82), compared to 2.4% (n = 126) in the no-RF group (p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed significantly poorer survival among RF patients (p < 0.001) compared to the no-RF group. RF remains a serious and common complication following cardiac surgery, particularly in patients undergoing complex procedures. RF is associated with significant comorbidity, increased hospital mortality, and reduced long-term survival. Future research efforts should focus on a more precise identification of patients at risk and the development of new treatment modalities that would potentially prevent the occurrence of this complication.

Clopidogrel treatment before coronary artery bypass graft surgery increases postoperative morbidity and blood product requirements.
An increasing number of patients are referred for coronary artery bypass graft surgery while treated with clopidogrel. This agent inhibits the platelet P2Y12 adenosine-5'-diphosphate (ADP) receptor, which results in an inhibition of platelet aggregation. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of preoperative clopidogrel treatment on postoperative bleeding, mortality, and morbidity in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Retrospective cohort study. University hospital (single institution). One hundred forty-four patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Seventy-two patients who received clopidogrel during the preoperative period formed the study group. Seventy-two patients (matched based on age, sex, and preoperative risk profile) served as the control group. Clopidogrel-treated patients received significantly more platelet (4.4 +/- 5.7 v 1.3 +/- 3.2 U, p < 0.001) and red blood cell (5.1 +/- 4.2 v 2.6 +/- 2.6 U, p < 0.001) transfusions compared with the control group. All-cause mortality and morbidity were significantly higher in clopidogrel-treated patients (n = 7, 9% v n = 1, 1%; p = 0.031). In addition, the lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and the hospital were significantly longer in these patients (2.5 +/- 2.7 v 1.4 +/- 0.9 days, p = 0.002; 9.9 +/- 11 v 6 +/- 2.5 days, p = 0.003). Despite an increased morbidity in the clopidogrel group, the midterm survival was similar between the 2 groups (1-year and 5-year survival 97% +/- 2% and 95.7% +/- 3% v 100% +/- 0% and 87% +/- 10%, respectively; p = 0.885). Preoperative clopidogrel is associated with increased transfusion requirement after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The present data suggest that all-cause mortality and major morbidity may also increase in these patients. In clopidogrel-treated patients, coronary artery bypass graft surgery should be delayed in the absence of specific medical indications as recommended by recent American Heart Association guidelines.

Results and predictors of early and late outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft surgery in octogenarians.
The aim of this study was to investigate early and late outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in a large cohort of octogenarian patients. The results were compared with 2 other age groups including septuagenarians and patients <70 years old. A retrospective study of consecutive patients undergoing CABG surgery using a computerized database based on the New York State Department of Health registry. Data collection was performed prospectively. Setting: A university hospital (single institution). Two thousand nine hundred eighty-five patients undergoing CABG surgery including 282 (9.4%) octogenarians, 852 (28.6%) septuagenarians, and 1851 (62%) patients younger than 70 years old. None. Patient characteristics, hospital mortality, morbidity, length of stay, and long-term survival were analyzed. Octogenarians were more likely female and presented significantly more often with comorbidities such as heart failure, an ejection fraction <30%, peripheral vascular disease, and aortic calcification. Crude hospital mortality was 4.6% (n = 13) in octogenarians compared with 2.2% (n = 19) in septuagenarians and 2.4% (n = 44) in patients <70 years old (p = 0.067). Respiratory failure and gastrointestinal complications occurred more frequently in octogenarians. The stroke rate was 1.6% and similar in the 3 age groups. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, age >80 years was not a predictor of hospital mortality. The length of stay was significantly higher in octogenarians compared with nonoctogenarians (16 +/- 24 days v 10 +/- 13 days, p < 0.001). Five-year survival was 63% +/- 4% in octogenarians and was similar to that of an age- and sex-matched general US population. Excellent results after CABG surgery can be expected in octogenarians, with a minimal increase in postoperative mortality and acceptable postoperative morbidity. Respiratory failure is the main postoperative complication in octogenarians. Recent advances in operative techniques and perioperative management have contributed in improving surgical outcome in these patients compared with historic reports.

Excellent early and late outcomes of aortic valve replacement in people aged 80 and older.
To investigate early and late outcome of aortic valve replacement (AVR) in a large cohort of patients aged 80 and older. Retrospective study of consecutive patients undergoing AVR using a computerized database based on the New York State Department of Health registry. Data collection was performed prospectively. University hospital (single institution). One thousand three hundred eight patients undergoing AVR (231 (17.6%) aged > or = 80, 1,077 (82.4%) < 80). Patient characteristics, hospital mortality, morbidity, length of stay and long-term survival were analyzed. Subjects aged 80 and older were more likely to be female, had a lower body mass index, and presented significantly more often with comorbidities such as heart failure, renal failure, and extensive aortic calcification. Crude hospital mortality was 5.2% (n=12) in subjects age 80 and older, compared with 4.5% (n=48) in those younger than 80 (P=.37). Respiratory failure occurred more frequently in those aged 80 and older. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, age of 80 and older was not a predictor of hospital mortality. The median length of stay was significantly higher in those aged 80 and older than in those younger than 80 (10 days vs 7 days, P=.01). Five-year survival was 64+/-5% in those aged 80 and older, which was similar to that of the age- and sex-matched general U.S. population. Excellent results after AVR can be expected in patients aged 80 and older, with minimal increase in postoperative mortality and acceptable postoperative morbidity. Respiratory failure is the main postoperative complication in patients aged 80 and older. Recent advances in operative techniques and perioperative management have contributed to better surgical outcomes in these patients than found in historical reports.

Tracheostomy is not a risk factor for deep sternal wound infection after cardiac surgery.
Previous studies on predictors of deep sternal wound infection (DSWI) have identified either respiratory failure or tracheostomy as a risk factor for the occurrence of this complication. This study was conducted to analyze the interaction between these two variables. We hypothesize that respiratory failure and not tracheostomy per se is associated with an increased risk of DSWI. We analyzed 2823 patients who underwent cardiac operations through median sternotomy between January 2002 and September 2006. Patients were divided into three groups: respiratory failure with or without tracheostomy (tracheostomy versus nontracheostomy) and patients without respiratory failure. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of DSWI in each group and its predictors. Postoperative respiratory failure was observed in 252 patients (9%): 144 without tracheostomy (57%) and 108 with tracheostomy (43%). The mean duration of intubation in nontracheostomy patients was 19 +/- 12 days. The mean duration to tracheostomy was 13 +/- 6 days. DSWI occurred in 38 patients (1.3%): patients with no respiratory failure, 1%; patients with respiratory failure, 5.1% (p < 0.001). The incidence of DSWI was similar between tracheostomy (4.6%) and nontracheostomy patients (5.6%, p = 0.5). The mean time to diagnosis of DSWI was 25 +/- 14 days and was similar for all groups. The mean number of days to tracheostomy was 12 +/- 3 days in DSWI patients and 13 +/- 6 in patients without DSWI (p = 0.7). In multivariate analysis, respiratory failure was the strongest predictor of DSWI (odds ratio, 5.2). Tracheostomy was not identified as a predictor of DSWI or hospital mortality. The incidence of DSWI remains high in patients with respiratory failure. Tracheostomy is not a risk factor for DSWI and serves as a surrogate for respiratory failure. Therefore, considering that early tracheostomy may be beneficial in patients with respiratory insufficiency, a more liberal approach to early tracheostomy may be warranted.

Impact of body mass index on early outcome and late survival in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting or valve surgery or both.
The influence of body mass on outcome after cardiac surgery remains controversial. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of body mass index (BMI) on early and late outcomes in a large series of patients who underwent cardiac surgery. We retrospectively analyzed 5,950 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery between January 1998 and September 2006. Patients were divided into 4 groups defined by BMI (weight divided by square of height [kilograms divided by meters squared]): underweight (<or=20 kg/m2): 6%, n=328; normal (>20 to <or=25 kg/m2): 34%, n=2,041; overweight (>25 to <or=30 kg/m2): 38%, n=2,289; obese (>30 kg/m2): 22%, n=1,292. Analysis was further refined by performing subgroup analysis according to the surgical procedure (valve surgery, coronary artery bypass grafting, and combined valve/coronary artery bypass grafting). Main outcome measure was the association between BMI and hospital mortality, postoperative morbidities, and late survival. Hospital mortality was 3.4% (n=203). There was no association between BMI and hospital mortality in the entire patient population. Multivariate analysis revealed obesity as an independent predictor of hospital mortality in patients who underwent valve surgery (odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 4.5, p=0.018). Obesity was associated with an increased risk for sternal infection (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.9, p=0.013), whereas underweight correlated with postoperative bleeding (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.6, p=0.017). Underweight was an independent predictor for decreased long-term survival (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.5, p<0.001). In conclusion, cardiac surgery can be performed safely in both underweight and obese patients but carries a higher postoperative rate of major complications.

Early and late outcomes of cardiac surgery in patients with moderate to severe preoperative renal dysfunction without dialysis.
It is well known that end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis negatively impacts early and late outcome of cardiac surgery. However, data with respect to non-dialysis-dependent renal failure patients (NDRF) are limited. We retrospectively analyzed 6940 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery from January 1998 to September 2006. Patients undergoing cardiac transplantation and ventricular assist device implantation (n=246) and dialysis dependent patients (n=245) were excluded. NDRF was present in 135 (2.1%) patients (mean age 64+/-14, 38% female). NRDF patients were more likely to present with cardiac related risk factors including ejection fraction <30% (P<0.001), prior myocardial infarction (P<0.001), congestive heart failure (P<0.001), active endocarditis (P<0.001) and hemodynamic instability (P<0.001). The estimated odds (OR) of hospital mortality in NDRF patients was 6.6 (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis retained NDRF as an independent factor for increasing the risk of hospital mortality among patients undergoing cardiac surgery (OR=5.1, P<0.001). Patients with NDRF were more likely to experience major postoperative complications when compared to the control group. One- and 5-year survival in NDRF patients was 82+/-4% and 63+/-6%, respectively, and significantly reduced compared to the control group. NDRF is a strong independent predictor of hospital mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Preoperative renal dysfunction also adversely affects long-term survival in these patients.

Incidence, treatment strategies and outcome of deep sternal wound infection after orthotopic heart transplantation.
Deep sternal wound infection (DSWI) after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) has not been well studied and its outcome remains largely unknown. Herein we report the incidence, clinical presentation, treatment strategies and early and late outcome after this complication. We retrospectively analyzed 149 consecutive patients (mean age 53 +/- 16 years, 113 [76%] males) who underwent OHT between January 1998 and December 2005. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 27 +/- 6 kg/m(2) and 30 (20%) patients were diabetics. Sixty (40%) patients had prior cardiac surgery, 11 (7%) underwent previous ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation, and 10 (7%) were in a critical hemodynamic state requiring inotropic support. DSWI occurred in 13 (8.7%) patients as compared with 1.7% of patients in our general cardiac surgery population (p < 0.001). Predictors of DSWI in univariate analyses were BMI >30 kg/m(2) (p = 0.02), previous heart surgery (p = 0.03), previous VAD (p = 0.006) and inotropic support (p = 0.04). Hospital mortality after DSWI was significantly increased as compared with patients without this complication (31% vs 8%, p = 0.03). One- and 5-year survival after DSWI was 100 +/- 12% and 80 +/- 18% as compared with 92 +/- 3% and 82 +/- 4% in patients without DSWI (p = 0.8). DSWI after OHT is a common complication and carries high mortality and morbidity rates. We were able to identify specific risk factors for this condition, such as prior VAD insertion and pre-operative inotropic support. Long-term survival after DSWI remains similar to that of transplant patients without this complication.

[Remodeling annuloplasty using a prosthetic ring designed for correcting type-IIIb ischemic mitral regurgitation].
The most common mechanism underlying ischemic mitral regurgitation is restricted leaflet motion during systole (Carpentier's type IIIb). Annuloplasty is the preferred technique for surgical repair. The new Carpentier-McCarthy-Adams IMR Etlogix prosthetic annuloplasty ring was designed specifically to address the particular peculiarities of this condition, principally asymmetric annular dilatation. The aims of this study were to review the rationale underlying the creation of the ring and to report our early clinical experience. The study included 40 patients with type-IIIb ischemic mitral regurgitation (grade 3+/4+) who underwent mitral value reconstruction using the new prosthetic ring between December 2003 and June 2005. Their mean age was 68+/-10 years. Concomitant procedures included coronary artery bypass grafting (n=27, 68%), tricuspid valvuloplasty (n=10, 25%), and a modified Maze procedure (n=9, 22%). The mean predicted EuroSCORE mortality for surgery was 17+/-11%. In-hospital mortality was 2.5% (n=1). Major postoperative morbidities included one case of stroke (2.5%), one renal failure (2.5%), and four respiratory failures (10%). Predischarge echocardiography revealed no mitral regurgitation in 36 patients (92%) and mild regurgitation in three (8%). Long-term follow-up echocardiography was carried out in 36 patients (92%) after 15-34 months, and showed that the rate of recurrence of (grade >/=2+) mitral regurgitation was 3% (n=1). The Carpentier-McCarthy-Adams IMR Etlogix(R) annuloplasty ring was effective in correcting type-IIIb ischemic mitral regurgitation. Its novel three-dimensional asymmetric shape is designed to deal with the anatomical and pathological characteristics of the condition and its use may, therefore, result in an excellent long-term outcome.

Epidemiology of stroke after cardiac surgery in the current era.
Previous studies of the epidemiology of stroke in patients undergoing cardiac surgery have been based primarily on patients having coronary bypass surgery and therefore have limited applicability to the more heterogenous populations seen in the current era. We examine the epidemiology of stroke after cardiac surgery in a contemporary surgical population. Retrospective analysis was conducted of a prospective database of 5085 adults (coronary bypass 2401, isolated valve 1003, valve/coronary bypass 546, thoracic aorta 517, transplant/assist device 179, adult congenital 124, other 315) who had cardiac surgery at a single institution over a 6-year period (1998-2004). Stroke occurred in 134 (2.6%) patients. Incidence varied according to procedure (coronary bypass 1.7%, isolated valve 1.8%, valve/coronary bypass 4.4%, and ascending aorta 4.6%). Patients who had a stroke had a higher perioperative mortality rate than that of patients who did not (32.8% vs 4.9%; P < .0001) and a longer period of hospitalization (median 30 days vs 7 days; P < .0001). Multivariate logistic analysis identified 10 preoperative predictors of stroke: gender, age, aortic surgery, previous stroke, critical preoperative state, poor ventricular function, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, unstable angina, and pulmonary hypertension. A logistic model was developed on the basis of these risk factors to predict the likelihood of stroke. We have demonstrated a relatively low incidence of stroke in a diverse contemporary cardiac surgical cohort. By enabling preoperative identification of patients at risk, our logistic model has the potential to improve preoperative patient counseling and selection and could help to define high-risk cohorts for research into stroke prevention.

Diabetes is not a risk factor for hospital mortality following contemporary coronary artery bypass grafting.
The outcome of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in diabetic patients has traditionally been worse than in non-diabetic patients. Recent studies have suggested an improvement in outcome in diabetic patients undergoing contemporary CABG. However, the direct impact of diabetes on mortality and morbidities following CABG remains unclear. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data of 2725 CABG patients from January 1998 to December 2005: one thousand and eighty-five (40%) diabetics and 1640 (60%) non-diabetics [mean age 65+/-11 years, 1882 (69%) male]. Subgroup analysis was performed for two study periods (1998-2002 vs. 2003-2005). The overall hospital mortality was 1.8% [n=50; diabetics: 2.4%, non-diabetics: 1.5% (P=0.07)]. The mortality rate among diabetics decreased from 3.1% in 1998-2002 to 1.0% in 2003-2005 (P=0.021). Diabetes was not an independent predictor of hospital mortality but predicted the occurrence of deep sternal wound infection (OR=3.77). Diabetes significantly decreased long-term survival [1-year and 5-year survival 94.7+/-0.7% and 81.9+/-1.4% for diabetic vs. 95.4+/-0.5% and 85.9+/-1.0% for non-diabetic patients (P=0.01)]. Excellent results following contemporary CABG can be expected in diabetics with a similar mortality compared to non-diabetics. Therefore, our data suggest that diabetes may, in fact, not be a risk factor for adverse outcome following CABG. However, long-term survival in diabetics remains significantly inferior compared to non-diabetics.

Principles of reconstructive surgery in degenerative mitral valve disease.
Degenerative mitral valve disease is the most common cause of mitral regurgitation (MR) in developed countries. The most common etiologies of valvular regurgitation are Barlow's disease and fibroelastic deficiency. The mechanism of MR is type II dysfunction (leaflet prolapse) due to chordae elongation or rupture in most patients. Associated annular dilation is a common lesion in almost all patients with chronic MR. By means of segmental valve analysis, isolated posterior leaflet prolapse (P2 segment) is often observed in patients with fibroelastic deficiency, whereas the prolapse of multiple segments or bileaflet prolapse is typically seen in patients with Barlow's disease. In patients with degenerative mitral valve disease and severe MR, reconstructive surgery should be performed before the occurrence of clinical symptoms, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, and left ventricular dysfunction or enlargement. The goals of reconstructive surgery are preservation or restoration of normal leaflet motion, creation of a large surface of coaptation, and stabilization of the entire annulus with a remodeling annuloplasty. Today, reconstructive techniques are standardized, reliable, and reproducible, and therefore should be applied systematically to all patients with degenerative valvular disease.

Excellent results of contemporary coronary artery bypass grafting with systematic application of modern perioperative strategies.
The patient population referred for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has become more challenging. The surgical population is aging and patients present with significant preoperative comorbidities. This worsening risk profile has led to the development of operative techniques (off-pump CABG) and perioperative measures (epi-aortic scanning, intensive insulin therapy) to preserve the quality of care following CABG. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of contemporary CABG following the implementation of the above measures in our practice. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data of 2725 patients undergoing CABG between 01/1998 and 12/2005 (mean age, 65 +/- 11 years; 843 [31%] female; mean ejection fraction, 45% +/- 14%). Outcome measures included hospital mortality, postoperative complications, and long-term survival and independent predictors of outcome. Subgroup analyses were performed for 2 study periods (1998-2002 versus 2003-2005) where the above measures were implemented and for patients undergoing conventional versus off-pump CABG. When comparing the 2 study periods, we observed a substantial worsening of the risk profile with an increased EuroSCORE predicted mortality from 6.4% +/- 6.8% to 7.0% +/- 7.8% (P = .028). During the same period, operative mortality decreased from 2.4% to 0.7% (P < .001). This reduction in mortality was also observed in diabetic patients (3.1% versus 1.0%, P = .021) and those with low ejection fraction (4% versus 2.6%, P = not significant). Off-pump procedures were performed with an increasing frequency in high-risk patients in whom we obtained excellent results. Finally, we observed a reduction of postoperative complications including respiratory failure (P = .013), gastrointestinal complications (P = .017), and stroke (P = .094). Independent predictors of mortality included renal failure (OR = 5.7), peripheral vascular disease (OR = 2.9), intra-aortic balloon pump (OR = 4.8), reoperation (OR = 3.3), and hypertension (OR = 2.3). Despite a worsening case mix, contemporary CABG can be performed with excellent results (operative mortality < 1%). Off-pump CABG performed in very high-risk patients obtains results similar to those of the general CABG population. Diabetes and ejection fraction were not independent predictors of early outcome. In our experience, these excellent outcomes were achieved by adopting an operative approach using modern perioperative management (epi-aortic scanning, intensive insulin therapy) and surgical techniques (off-pump CABG) based on individual patients.

Excellent results of cardiac surgery in patients with previous liver transplantation.
Cardiovascular diseases requiring surgical therapy in patients with prior liver transplantation are rare. Little is known about the outcome of patients with liver allograft undergoing cardiac surgery. Herein we report our experience in this patient population with an emphasis on operative outcomes and mid-term survival. Between January 1998 and December 2004, 12 patients (mean +/- standard deviation age 68 +/- 9 years, 7 [58%] male) with previous liver transplantation who underwent cardiac surgery were identified. Main outcome measures were hospital mortality, postoperative complications, allograft function, and long-term survival. There was no in-hospital mortality. Three major complications (25%) occurred, including 1 each (8%) of respiratory failure, renal failure, and biliary leakage. All complications were resolved by the time of discharge. Allograft dysfunction determined by an increase of liver function parameters was noticed in 4 (33%) and recovered before discharge. The average length of stay in intensive care unit was 72 +/- 45 hours, and the mean length of stay in hospital was 22 +/- 17 days. One- and 5-year survival was 91% +/- 8% and 67% +/- 14%, respectively. Cardiac surgery can be performed safely in liver transplant recipients with extremely low mortality and acceptable morbidities. Allograft dysfunction is a common finding, but it is transient, with early functional recovery. Five-year survival of liver recipients undergoing cardiac procedures is similar to that of the general population undergoing cardiac surgery. Our data suggest that these patients should be considered for cardiac surgery in reference centers with expertise in complex cardiac procedures and perioperative management of these highly specific patients.

Results and predictors of early and late outcome of coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with severely depressed left ventricular function.
Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a well-accepted therapeutic approach in patients with symptomatic multivessel coronary artery disease and severely depressed left ventricular function. However, the potential impact of off-pump CABG in this group of patients remains unknown. In addition, there are only scarce data regarding long-term survival and its predictors in this patient population. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data of 2,725 consecutive patients (mean age, 65 +/- 11 years; 843 (31%) female) undergoing CABG between January 1998 and December 2005 (ejection fraction [EF] < or = 0.30; n = 495, 18%). Outcome measures included hospital mortality, major complications, and long-term survival. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of hospital mortality and late survival. Subgroup analysis for patients with EF less than or equal to 0.30 undergoing conventional CABG (n = 424, 86%) versus off-pump CABG (n = 71, 14%) was performed. Hospital mortality was 1.8% (EF < or = 0.30, 3.6%; EF > 0.30, 1.4%; p = 0.002). Off-pump CABG did not have an impact on operative mortality (on-pump, 4%; off-pump, 3%; p = 0.509). Ejection fraction of 0.30 or less was not an independent risk factor of hospital mortality but predicted respiratory failure (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3) and sepsis (OR, 1.4). Long-term survival was significantly decreased in patients with EF of 0.30 or less: 1-year and 5-year survival 88% +/- 1.5% and 75% +/- 2.2% versus 96% +/- 0.4% and 81% +/- 1.2%, respectively (p = 0.001). Reoperation (OR, 6.9), peripheral vascular disease (OR, 3.2), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 3.0), congestive heart failure (OR, 2.7), and female sex (OR, 2.1) were independent predictors of long-term survival. Excellent results after CABG can be expected in patients with EF of 0.30 or less, with minimal increase in mortality and acceptable postoperative morbidity. Long-term survival remains limited, but recent results are substantially better than historical reports. Careful preoperative patient selection and perioperative management are essential in these patients undergoing CABG.

Cardiac myxoma: preoperative diagnosis using a multimodal imaging approach and surgical outcome in a large contemporary series.
Diagnosis of cardiac myxoma is typically suggested in the presence of symptoms and echocardiographic findings of an intracardiac mass and confirmed histologically. Coronary angiography (CA) and cardiac magnetic-resonance-imaging (MRI) may provide specific additional information which could lead to a precise preoperative diagnosis. Herein we report a series of 28 patients who underwent excision of myxoma between 1998 and 2005. Data analysis included patient demographics, clinical presentation, imaging modalities, and operative outcome. Echocardiography revealed an intra-atrial mass in all patients but did not differentiate between myxoma and other formations such as thrombi. CA showed neovascularization suggestive of cardiac tumor in 12 (53%) patients. MRI demonstrated specific characteristics of myxomatous tissue in all cases. Surgical removal was performed with no hospital mortality or major complications. Mid-term survival was similar to that of the general population. In patients with a cardiac mass, echocardiography remains the first diagnostic imaging modality but does not allow definite discrimination between cardiac tumors and thrombi. CA shows neovascularization in 50% and has, therefore, a low sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing the nature of the mass. MRI shows specific tissue characteristics facilitating the diagnosis of myxoma preoperatively. Surgery should be performed promptly and this can provide excellent early and mid-term results.

Predictors and outcome of gastrointestinal complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
To determine the incidence and independent predictors of gastrointestinal complications (GICs) following cardiac surgery. Gastrointestinal ischemia and hemorrhage represent a rare but devastating complication following heart surgery. The profile of patients referred for cardiac surgery has changed during the last decade, questioning the validity of previously reported incidence and risk factors. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from 4819 patients undergoing cardiac surgery between 1998 and 2004. Patients with GICs were compared with the entire patient population. Study endpoints were mortality, postoperative morbidities, and long-term survival. GICs occurred in 51 (1.1%) patients. Etiologies were intestinal ischemia (n = 30; 59%) and hemorrhage (n = 21; 41%). The incidence decreased during the study period (1998-2001: 1.3%, 2002-2004: 0.7%; P = 0.04). The incidence per type of procedure was as follows: coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)/valve (2.4%), aortic surgery (1.7%), valve surgery (1.0%), and CABG (0.5%; P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed age (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1), myocardial infarction (OR = 2.5), CHF (OR = 2.4), hemodynamic instability (OR = 2.8), cardiopulmonary bypass time >120 minutes (OR = 6.2), peripheral vascular disease (OR = 2.2), renal (OR = 3.2), and hepatic failure (OR = 10.8) as independent predictors of GICs. The overall hospital mortality among patients with GICs was 33%. Long-term survival was significantly decreased in patients with GICs compared with the control group. Gastrointestinal complications following cardiac surgery remain rare with an incidence <1% in a contemporary series. The key to a lower incidence of GICs lies in systematic application of preventive measures and new advances in intraoperative management. Identification of independent risk factors would facilitate the determination of patients who would benefit from additional perioperative monitoring. Future resources should therefore be redirected to mitigate GICs in high-risk patients.

Multimodal characterization of a large right atrial mass after surgical repair of an atrial septal defect.
A 43-year-old woman with exertional dyspnea and a history of surgically repaired atrial septal defect was referred for a transthoracic echocardiogram, which demonstrated a large, mobile mass in her right atrium. The mass was further characterized with contrast transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and delayed enhancement MRI, which together suggested a thrombus, attached to the eustachian valve and prolapsing through the tricuspid valve. The mass was resected and the diagnosis confirmed on histopathologic examination. This case illustrates the utility of a multimodal approach in characterizing cardiac masses.

Computed tomography angiography is an excellent tool for the diagnosis of congenital coronary artery anomalies: a report of 2 cases.
Congenital coronary artery anomalies are sporadically discovered in patients undergoing coronary angiography and in autopsy series. Although most anomalies are clinically insignificant, some may become causes of cardiovascular morbidities and mortality. Diagnosis is commonly made with conventional coronary artery angiography. The current development of modern cardiac computed tomography allows less invasive imaging of the coronary arteries and might provide additional anatomical and morphological information. Herein, we report our experience with computed tomography coronary angiography, describing 2 clinical cases of patients with symptomatic congenital coronary artery anomalies requiring cardiac surgery.

Management of patients undergoing multivalvular surgery for carcinoid heart disease: the role of the anaesthetist.
The management of patients with carcinoid heart disease poses two major challenges for the anaesthetist: carcinoid crisis and low cardiac output secondary to right ventricular (RV) failure. Carcinoid crises may be precipitated by the administration of catecholamines and histamine-releasing drugs. We analysed a series of 11 patients [six males, median (range) age 60 (42-73) yr] with severe symptomatic carcinoid heart disease who underwent multivalve surgery (right-sided valves, n=8; right- and left-sided valves, n=3) between 2001 and 2007. All patients received octreotide intraoperatively [650 (300-1050) microg] to prevent carcinoid symptoms and vasoplegia. Those patients on a greater preoperative octreotide regime required additional intraoperative octreotide [median (range) dose 320 (300-850) vs 750 (650-1050) mug]. Similarly, the use of greater doses of aprotinin (> 5 KIU) was associated with greater requirements for octreotide [475 (300-700) vs 750 (320-1050) microg] and higher glucose levels (> or =8.5 mmol litre(-1)). Catecholamines were generally required in those patients who presented with a worse New York Heart Association functional class. Overall mortality was 18% (n=2) and only one episode of mild intraoperative carcinoid crisis was observed. Carcinoid crisis and RV failure still remain the primary challenges for the anaesthesiologist while managing patients with carcinoid heart disease. Our study supports the administration of catecholamines to wean patients off cardiopulmonary bypass, particularly in the presence of myocardial dysfunction. Those patients on higher octreotide dosages may require close intraoperative glucose monitoring. Despite high operative mortality, surgical outcome has been improved potentially due to earlier patient referral and better perioperative management.
