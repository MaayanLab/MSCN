The dominant negative {beta} isoform of the glucocorticoid receptor is uniquely expressed in erythroid cells expanded from polycythemia vera patients.
Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonists increase erythropoiesis in-vivo and in-vitro. To clarify the effect of the dominant negative GR? isoform (unable to bind STAT-5) on erythropoiesis, erythroblast (EB) expansion cultures of mononuclear cells (MNC) from 18 normal donors (ND) and 16 polycythemia vera patients (PV) were studied. GR? was expressed in all PV EBs but in EBs from only 1 ND. The A3669G polymorphism which stabilizes GR? mRNA had great frequency in PV (55%, n=22, p=0.0028) and myelofibrosis (35%, n=20) patients than in ND (9%, n=22) or essential thrombocythemia patients (6%, n=15). Dexamethasone (DXM) stimulation of ND cultures increased the number of immature EBs characterized by low GATA1 and ?-globin expression but PV cultures generated great numbers of immature EBs with low levels of GATA1 and ?-globin irrespective of DXM stimulation. In ND EBs, STAT-5 was not phosphorylated after DXM+erythropoietin treatment and did not form transcriptionally active complexes with GR? while in PV EBs STAT-5 was constitutively phosphorylated but the formation of GR/STAT-5 complexes was prevented by expression of GR?. These data indicate that GR? expression and the presence of A3669G likely contribute to development of erythrocytosis in PV and provide a potential target for identification of novel therapeutic agents.
