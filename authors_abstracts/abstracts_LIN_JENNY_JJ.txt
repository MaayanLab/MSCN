Impact of an Electronic Health Record on Follow-up Time for Markedly Elevated Serum Potassium Results.
Follow-up of abnormal ambulatory laboratory results is often suboptimal. The impact of an ambulatory electronic health record (EHR) on follow-up of markedly elevated blood potassium (K(+)) results was investigated via a retrospective medical record review-before and after EHR implementation-of patients at an adult primary care practice who had a nonhemolyzed K(+) ? 6.0 mEq/L. In all, 188 patients in the pre-EHR group and 30 in the EHR group satisfied inclusion criteria. The mean K(+) for the 2 groups was 6.3 mEq/L. The EHR group had 4.5 times the odds (95% confidence interval = 1.3-15.8) of having their episodes of hyperkalemia followed up within 4 days. Patients in the EHR group were also more likely to have their blood K(+) rechecked within 4 days (63.3% vs 43.6%; P = .044). An ambulatory EHR with a results management system improves documentation and time to follow-up for patients with markedly abnormal lab results.

Underuse of breast cancer adjuvant treatment: patient knowledge, beliefs, and medical mistrust.
Little is known about why women with breast cancer who have surgery do not receive proven effective postsurgical adjuvant treatments. We surveyed 258 women who recently underwent surgical treatment at six New York City hospitals for early-stage breast cancer about their care, knowledge, and beliefs about breast cancer and its treatment. As per national guidelines, all women should have received adjuvant treatment. Adjuvant treatment data were obtained from inpatient and outpatient charts. Factor analysis was used to create scales scored to 100 of treatment beliefs and knowledge, medical mistrust, and physician communication about treatment. Bivariate and multivariate analyses assessed differences between treated and untreated women. Compared with treated women, untreated women were less likely to know that adjuvant therapies increase survival (on a 100-point scale; 66 v 75; P < .0001), had greater mistrust (64 v 53; P = .001), and had less self-efficacy (92 v 97; P < .05); physician communication about treatment did not affect patient knowledge of treatment benefits (r = 0.8; P = .21). Multivariate analysis found that untreated women were more likely to be 70 years or older (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.13), to have comorbidities (aRR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.12), and to express mistrust in the medical delivery system (aRR, 1.003; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.007), even though they were more likely to believe adjuvant treatments were beneficial (aRR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98 to 0.99; model c, 0.84; P < or = .0001). Patient knowledge and beliefs about treatment and medical mistrust are mutable factors associated with underuse of effective adjuvant therapies. Physicians may improve cancer care by ensuring that discussions about adjuvant therapy include a clear presentation of the benefits, not just the risks of treatment, and by addressing patient trust in and concerns about the medical system.

Physician attitudes toward opioid prescribing for patients with persistent noncancer pain.
Physicians frequently express dissatisfaction about caring for patients with chronic pain and frequently report that inadequate training and concern about addiction are impediments to prescribing opioids. Elderly patients with chronic pain may be at increased risk of experiencing uncontrolled pain and this patient population is increasingly being cared for by geriatricians rather than internists. We sought to determine if there is a differential impact on internists and geriatricians of the factors that adversely affect attitudes toward opioid prescribing. Anonymous survey of geriatric and internal medicine physicians at a large urban academic medical center about their beliefs and behaviors regarding opioid prescribing. One hundred thirty-two of 187 physicians completed the survey for an overall response rate of 71%. Controlling for level of training, internists were more likely to be concerned about illegal diversion (adjusted odds ratio=10.0, P=0.004), were more concerned about causing addiction (38% vs. 0%, P<0.001), and were more likely to be concerned about their inability to prescribe the correct opioid dose (adjusted odds ratio=11.1, P=0.020). Factors shown to have an adverse affect on opioid prescribing disproportionately impact on the attitudes of internists compared with geriatricians. Further research is needed to determine if there is also a differential impact on how internists care for their elderly patients with chronic pain.
