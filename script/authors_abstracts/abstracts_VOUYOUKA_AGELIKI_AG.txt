Effect of gender on long-term survival after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair based on results from the Medicare national database.
OBJECTIVES: Historically, women have higher procedurally related mortality rates than men for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Although endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has improved these rates for men and women, effects of gender on long-term survival with different types of AAA repair, such as EVAR vs open aneurysm repair (OAR), need further investigation. To address this issue, we analyzed survival in matched cohorts who received EVAR or OAR for both elective (eAAA) and ruptured AAA (rAAA). METHODS: Using the Medicare Beneficiary Database (1995-2006), we compiled a cohort of patients who underwent OAR or EVAR for eAAA (n = 322,892) or rAAA (n = 48,865). Men and women were matched by propensity scores, accounting for baseline demographics, comorbid conditions, treating institution, and surgeon experience. Frailty models were used to compare long-term survival of the matched groups. RESULTS: Perioperative mortality for eAAAs was significantly lower among EVAR vs OAR recipients for both men (1.84% vs 4.80%) and women (3.19% vs 6.37%, P < .0001). One difference, however, was that the survival benefit of EVAR was sustained for the 6 years of follow-up in women but disappeared in 2 years in men. Similarly, the survival benefit of men vs women after elective EVAR disappeared after 1.5 to 2 years. For rAAAs, 30-day mortality was significantly lower for EVAR recipients compared with OAR recipients, for both men (33.43% vs 43.70% P < .0001) and women (41.01% vs 48.28%, P = .0201). Six-year survival was significantly higher for men who received EVAR vs those who received OAR (P = .001). However, the survival benefit for women who received EVAR compared with OAR disappeared in 6 months. Survival was also substantially higher for men than women after emergent EVAR (P = .0007). CONCLUSIONS: Gender disparity is evident from long-term outcomes after AAA repair. In the case for rAAA, where the long-term outcome for women was significantly worse than for men, the less invasive EVAR treatment did not appear to benefit women to the same extent that it did for men. Although the long-term outcome after open repair for elective AAA was also worse for women, EVAR benefit for women was sustained longer than for men. These associations require further study to isolate specific risk factors that would be potential targets for improving AAA management.

The success of endovascular therapy for all TransAtlantic Society Consensus graded femoropopliteal lesions.
Advances in technology and practice have led to increased endovascular management of all TransAtlantic Society Consensus (TASC)-graded lesions. This study aims to evaluate the success of endovascular therapy in the management of TASC-graded femoropopliteal lesions. Patients undergoing endovascular treatment for femoropopliteal lesions between July 1999 and August 2008 were divided by TASC scores and evaluated for primary, assisted-primary, and secondary patency rates at 12 and 24 months. Secondary endpoints included limb loss and postoperative complications. A total of 499 femoropopliteal lesions in 427 patients were treated with endovascular interventions. Score distribution for TASC type A, type B, type C, and type D lesions was 26 (5.2%), 140 (28.1%), 168 (33.7%), and 165 (33.1%), respectively. Primary, assisted-primary, and secondary patency rates at 24 months were 77.7 ± 3.2%, 78.9 ± 3.2%, and 86.7 ± 2.6%, respectively, for TASC type A + B lesions, 76.0 ± 3.3%, 77.2 ± 3.2%, and 85.0 ± 2.8%, respectively, for TASC type C lesions, and 61.2 ± 3.8%, 61.2 ± 3.8%, and 78.2 ± 3.2%, respectively, for TASC type D lesions. Compared with TASC type A + B and TASC type C lesions, TASC type D lesions were associated with worse primary and assisted-primary patency rates. However, there was no statistically significant difference in secondary patency between TASC type A + B and TASC type D lesions. The TASC score was not a significant predictor of postoperative complication rates. The 24-month limb salvage rate in patients with TASC type D lesions presenting with critical limb ischemia was 71.9 ± 8.0%. It was observed that all femoropopliteal lesions can be safely and effectively managed with endovascular therapy. Although TASC type D lesions do have lower primary and assisted-primary patency rates, high secondary patency rates comparable with other TASC scores can be achieved with effective prevention of limb loss. These data provide evidence to support endovascular therapy as primary management for all femoropopliteal lesions regardless of the TASC score.

Lessons learned from the analysis of gender effect on risk factors and procedural outcomes of lower extremity arterial disease.
Despite overall improvement, there is still a gender-related disparity in the outcomes of lower extremities peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We analyzed sex-related variability among factors that are known to influence outcomes. Data on PAD inpatient hospitalizations from New York, New Jersey, and Florida state hospital discharge databases (1998-2007) were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Of the 372,692 surgical hospitalizations identified, 162,730 (43.66%) involved women. Men and women undergoing vascular procedures differed in that more men smoked (18% vs 14%; P<.0001), and more men had coronary artery disease (40% vs 33%; P<.0001). Women were more likely to be obese (11.86% vs 4.89%; P<.0001), black (18.81% vs 12.66%; P<.0001), older, and have critical limb ischemia (CLI) (39.41% vs 37.67%; P<.0001). They had higher mortality (5.26% vs 4.21%; P<.0001) and complication rates, especially bleeding (10.62 % vs 8.19%; P<.0001) and infection (3.23% vs 2.88%; P<.0001). Mortality rates after endovascular procedures were lower and showed marginal difference between genders (2.87% vs 2.11%; P<.0001). The difference was more pronounced after open revascularizations (5.05% for women vs 4.00% for men; P<.0001) and amputations (9.82% for women vs 8.82% for men; P<.0001). Bleeding differences between men and women were greatest when both open and endovascular procedures were done during the same hospitalizations and lowest after major amputations. Similar to bleeding, transgender differences in postoperative infections were more pronounced after combination of open and endovascular procedures. Using a multivariable model, female gender remained a predictor of perioperative mortality, infection, and bleeding after vascular intervention (odds ratios 1.15, 1.21, and 1.32, respectively). Female gender negatively influenced the mortality of patients with cerebrovascular and coronary disease and those of black race even after adjusting for relevant clinical and demographic risk factors. Gender effect on mortality dissipated in octogenarians and patients with claudication. Female gender continues to be an important risk factor that negatively influences the outcomes of vascular interventions; however, these effects vary between different high-risk groups and procedures. Gender effect on mortality dissipates in elderly patients. Prompt recognition of the associations between gender and various risk factors of cardiovascular disease and aggressive modification of these risk factors in female patients may improve gender-related disparity in the outcomes of vascular disease.

Analysis of gender-related differences in lower extremity peripheral arterial disease.
Gender-related differences continue to challenge the management of lower extremity (LE) peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in women. We analyzed the time-trends in hospital care of such differences. Data for patients with PAD from New York, New Jersey, and Florida state hospital inpatient discharge databases (1998-2007) were analyzed using univariate and multivariate regression analyses. The 2.4 million PAD-related inpatient discharge records analyzed showed a slight decrease of inpatient procedures for both genders. Compared with men, women had 18% to 27% fewer PAD and 33% to 49% fewer vascular procedural hospitalizations (P < .0001). They were persistently more likely than men to be admitted emergently (56% vs 51% in 1998 and 57% vs 53% in 2007) and discharged to a nursing home. During the study period, the amputation rate declined by 36% in women and 21% in men with PAD, and similarly, open procedures decreased by 36% and 30%. Endovascular procedures, however, increased by 150% in women and 144% in men. Procedural mortality was 4.95% vs 4.37% for men (P < .0001). Female mortality rates were persistently higher after amputations (9.89% vs 8.90%, P < .0001), open (5.49% vs 4.00%, P < .0001), and endovascular procedures (2.87% vs 2.10%, P < .0001). Time trends showed improved mortality for men and women, with a stable difference between the two. The analysis of representative state administrative databases of inpatient care records demonstrated improvements in mortality and amputation rates over time. However, a gender-related disparity in PAD outcomes remains that merits further investigation.
