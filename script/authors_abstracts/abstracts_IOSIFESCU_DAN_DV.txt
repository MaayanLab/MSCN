Major depressive disorder is a common illness, particularly in patients with medical and neurologic conditions. This article summarizes current data on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of major depression, with special emphasis on the diagnosis and treatment of depression in medical and neurologic patients. We reviewed the role of pharmacotherapies, psychotherapies, somatic treatments, and alternative remedies and we included practical advice for clinician regarding the timing and sequence of these treatments, the role of standardized depression scales, and the criteria for referrals to specialty consultants.
