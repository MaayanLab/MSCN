Electronic collaboration: using technology to solve old problems of quality care.
The participants of the Electronic Collaboration working group of the 2010 Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference developed recommendations and research questions for improving regional quality of care through the use of electronic collaboration. A writing group devised a working draft prior to the meeting and presented this to the breakout session at the consensus conference for input and approval. The recommendations include: 1) patient health information should be available electronically across the entire health care delivery system from the 9-1-1 call to the emergency department (ED) visit through hospitalization and outpatient care, 2) relevant patient health information should be shared electronically across the entire health care delivery system, 3) Web-based collaborative technologies should be employed to facilitate patient transfer and timely access to specialists, 4) personal health record adoption should be considered as a way to improve patient health, and 5) any comprehensive reform of regionalization in emergency care must include telemedicine. The workgroup emphasized the need for funding increases so that research in this new and exciting area can expand.

Clinical information system and process redesign improves emergency department efficiency.
Fueled by a decade-long increase in emergency department (ED) visits with a concomitant decrease in hospital bed capacity and the number of hospital EDs, ED crowding has reached crisis proportions. Robust information systems and process redesign are two strategies to improve the safety and quality of emergency care. At the ED at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, an urban, tertiary care academic medical center in New York City, elements of departmental work flow were redesigned to streamline patient throughput before implementation of a fully integrated emergency department information system (EDIS) with patient tracking, computerized charting and order entry, and direct access to patient historical data from the hospital data repository. Pre- and postintervention data were analyzed to examine the impact on (ED) efficiency. The length of stay for all patients (arrival to time patient left ED) decreased by 1.94 hours, from 6.69 (n = 508) pre-intervention to 4.75 (n = 691) postintervention (p < .001); doctor-to-disposition time (first doctor-patient contact to disposition decision) decreased by 1.90 hours, from 3.64 (n = 508) to 1.74 (n = 691; p < .001); door-to-doctor time (triage to first doctor-patient contact) decreased by 0.54 hours, from 1.22 (n = 508) to 0.68 (n = 691; p < .001). X-ray turnaround time (TAT) decreased by 0.18 hours from 0.92 (n = 60) to 0.74 (n = 108; p = .179); computerized tomography (CT) scan TAT decreased by 1.56 hours, from 3.89 (n = 40) to 2.33 (n = 29; p < .001), lab TAT decreased by 0.59 hours, from 2.03 (n = 121) to 1.44 (n = 271; p = .006). Increasing the clinical information available at the bedside and improving departmental work flow through EDIS implementation and process redesign led to decreased patient throughput times and improved ED efficiency.
