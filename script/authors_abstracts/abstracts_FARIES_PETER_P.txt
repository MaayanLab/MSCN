Diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for small abdominal aortic aneurysms.
Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) affect 5% of the population in developed countries and are characterized by progressive aortic dilatation with an unpredictable time course. This condition is more common in men than in women, and in smokers than in nonsmokers. If left untreated, AAA can result in aortic rupture and death. Pathologically, aortic extracellular matrix degradation, inflammation, and neovascularization are hallmarks of AAA. Diagnosis of AAA and subsequent surveillance utilize established aortic imaging methods, such as ultrasound, CT, and MRI. More-speculative diagnostic approaches include molecular and cellular imaging methods that interrogate the underlying pathological processes at work within the aneurysm. In this Review, we explore the current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the management of AAA. We also describe the diagnostic potential of new imaging techniques and therapeutic potential of new treatments for the management of small AAA.

The role of anatomic factors in predicting success of endovascular repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms.
We evaluated the results of thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) to determine what anatomic factors influenced the clinical outcomes. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) angiograms of 65 patients who underwent TEVAR were analyzed using 3-dimensional imaging. The proximal and distal neck, thoracic aneurysm, and iliac arteries were measured for angulation, diameter, length, calcification, and tortuosity. Immediate technical success and clinical success were measured. Immediate technical success was achieved in 91% (59 of 65) of the patients analyzed. One patient died in the operating room during treatment of rupture. Clinical success was achieved in 83% (54 of 65) of patients at follow-up. Four patients had small endoleaks with no sac enlargement at follow-up. One patient was converted to open repair. Severe iliac calcification was found to be significant for deployment failure. The mean follow-up is 8 months (1-36 months). Increased iliac calcification and increased iliac tortuosity correlate with an inability to successfully deploy the device.

Endovascular treatment of visceral artery aneurysms.
Visceral artery aneurysms, although uncommon, can present with life-threatening hemorrhage. The increasing use of imaging studies has allowed for earlier identification and intervention of these aneurysms, thus avoiding the high morbidity and mortality associated with rupture. The treatment options for visceral artery aneurysms range from conventional open surgical repair to minimally invasive techniques using covered stents or embolization materials. Anatomic features and patient selection determine which treatment option would result in the most durable treatment and outcome. This article reviews our experience with the endovascular treatment of visceral artery aneurysms.
