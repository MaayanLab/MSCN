Common hepatic artery arising from the left gastric artery: a rare anatomic variation identified on a cadaveric liver donor.
Anatomical variations of the arterial supply of the liver are not uncommon. The typical normal "textbook" anatomy of the hepatic artery is found only in approximately half of the cases. Some of the variations such as the presence of a right or left hepatic branch are more common, but other ones are extremely rare. We describe here a rare case in which the common hepatic artery arose from the left gastric artery, found during a cadaveric liver donor harvesting and confirmed with imaging studies. Cases like this one highlight the importance of knowing the hepatic arterial anatomy and the possibility of its numerous variations by the transplant and hepatobiliary surgeon.

Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome after intestinal transplantation.
Strongyloides stercoralis is a helminth with the ability to autoinfect the human host and persist asymptomatically for several years. Immunosuppression can accelerate autoinfection and result in Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome (SHS), which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients, particularly in the setting of rejection, are at increased risk for reactivation of latent infections, such as Strongyloides. We describe a case of SHS in an intestinal transplant recipient; we hypothesize that she acquired the infection from the donor. We also review the current literature and address both prophylaxis and treatment of strongyloidiasis in the solid organ transplant patient.
