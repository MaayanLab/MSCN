Gaucher disease: when molecular testing and clinical presentation disagree -the novel c.1226A>G(p.N370S)--RecNcil allele.
We report a 31 year old woman who had prenatal carrier screening for Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) genetic diseases and was found to have two acid ß-glucosidase (GBA) mutations, c.1226A>G(p.N370S) and c.1448T>C(p.L444P), consistent with the diagnosis of Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD1). This genotype typically manifests in late-adolescence with hepatosplenomegaly and early-onset bone involvement. The Proband had a normal physical examination, no organomegaly, and normal blood counts, skeletal survey, and bone density. Leukocyte acid ß-glucosidase and plasma chitotriosidase activities were normal. To investigate these unexpected results, her GBA alleles were RT-PCR amplified and sequenced. Five RT-PCR clones were negative for both mutations, while five clones had the c.1226A>G(p.N370S) and c.1448T>C(p.L444P) mutations, along with c.1483G>C(p.A456P), and c.1497G>C(p.V460V) mutations, the latter three lesions composing the rare GBA pseudogene-derived RecNcil allele. Genetic testing misdiagnosed the asymptomatic Proband as affected with Type 1 Gaucher disease; however, molecular studies revealed a novel allele with the two common GBA mutations on the RecNcil background. This allele presumably arose by crossing-over between a c.1226A>G allele and the pseudogene, gene conversion, or a new c.1226A>G mutation on the RecNcil background. This novel complex allele highlights a limitation of carrier screening for GD.

Congenital Erythropoietic Porphyria: Characterization of Murine Models of the Severe Common (C73R/C73R) and Later-Onset Genotypes.
Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is an autosomal recessive disorder due to the deficient activity of uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS). Knock-in mouse models were generated for the common, hematologically severe human genotype, C73R/C73R, and milder genotypes (C73R/V99L and V99L/V99L). The UROS enzyme specific activities in the livers and erythrocytes of these mice averaged approximately 1.2%, 11% and 19% of normal, respectively. C73R/C73R mice that survived fetal life to weaning age (~12%) had a severe microcytic hypochromic anemia (Hb=7.9 g/dL, MCV=26.6 fl, MCHC=27.4 g/dL, RDW=37.7%, 19% reticulocytes) and massively accumulated isomer I porphyrins (95 ?M, 183 ?M and 44 ?M in erythrocytes, spleen and liver, respectively), but a nearly normal lifespan. In adult C73R/C73R mice, spleen and liver weights were 8.2- and 1.5-fold increased, respectively. C73R/V99L mice were mildly anemic, (Hb=14.0 g/dL, and MCH=13.3), and minimally accumulated porphyrins (0.10, 5.54, and 0.58 ?M in erythrocytes, spleen and liver, respectively), while adult V99L/V99L mice were normal. Of note, even the mildest genotype, V99L/V99L, exhibited porphyria in utero that disappeared by two months of age. These severe and mild mouse models inform therapeutic interventions and permit further investigation of the porphyrin-induced hematopathology, which leads to the photo-induced cutaneous lesions. Of significance for therapeutic intervention, these mouse models suggest that only 11% of wild-type activity might be needed to reverse the pathology in CEP patients.

Detection of large gene rearrangements in X-linked genes by dosage analysis: identification of novel ?-galactosidase A (GLA) deletions causing Fabry disease.
For most Mendelian disorders, targeted genome sequencing is an effective method to detect causative mutations. However, sequencing PCR-amplified exonic regions and their intronic boundaries can miss large deletions or duplications and mutations that lead to PCR failures in autosomal dominant disorders and in heterozygote detection for X-linked diseases. Here, a method is described for detecting large (>50?bp) deletions/duplications in the X-linked ?-galactosidase A (GLA) gene, which cause Fabry disease. Briefly, multiplex PCR mixtures were designed to amplify each GLA exon and an unrelated internal control exon to normalize GLA exonic amplicon peak heights. For each normalized GLA amplicon, the normal control female to male peak-height ratios were 1.8 to 2.2 (expected 2.0), whereas the expected ratios for deletions or duplications would be ?1.0 or 3.0, respectively. Using this method, three novel deletions, c.369+3_547+954del4096insT, c.194+2049_369+773del2619insCG, and c.207_369+651del814ins231, were detected in unrelated women with signs and/or symptoms suggestive of Fabry disease, but no "sequencing-detectable" mutations. The deletions were confirmed by sequencing their respective GLA RT-PCR products. This method can identify gene rearrangements that may be cryptic to genomic DNA sequencing and can be readily adapted to other X-linked or autosomal dominant genes.

Tamoxifen metabolite isomer separation and quantification by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
Tamoxifen (Tam), the antiestrogen used to treat estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer is a pro-drug that is converted to its major active metabolites, endoxifen and 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OH-Tam) by various biotransformation enzymes of which cytochrome P450-2D6 (CYP2D6) is key. The usual Tam dose is 20 mg daily; however, the plasma active metabolite concentrations vary due to common genetic variants encoding the biotransformation enzymes and environmental factors (e.g., concomitant drugs) that inhibit these enzymes. Effective treatment depends on adequate Tam conversion to its active isomers. To monitor metabolite plasma levels, a novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed to separate and quantitate Tam, N-desmethyl-tamoxifen (ND-Tam), and tamoxifen-N-oxide (Tam-N-oxide), and the E, Z, and Z' isomers of endoxifen and 4-OH-Tam. Known standards were used to identify each metabolite/isomer. Quantitation of these metabolites in plasma was linear from 0.6 to 2000 nM. Intra- and inter-assay reproducibilities were 0.2-8.4% and 0.6-6.3%, respectively. Accuracy determined by spike experiments with known standards was 86-103%. Endoxifen, 4-OH-Tam, and their isomers were stable in fresh frozen plasma for ?6 months. This method provides the first sensitive, specific, accurate, and reproducible quantitation of Tam and its metabolite isomers for monitoring Tam-treated breast cancer patients.

Type 1 Gaucher disease: significant disease manifestations in "asymptomatic" homozygotes.
Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD), an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, is most prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population. Experts have suggested that up to two-thirds of AJ homozygotes for the common mutation (N370S) are asymptomatic throughout life and never come to medical attention. However, there are no systematic studies of N370S homozygotes to support this presumption. Prenatal carrier screening of 8069 AJ adults for 6 common GD mutations was performed. Gaucher disease manifestations in 37 previously unrecognized homozygotes were assessed by clinical, laboratory, and imaging studies. Among the 8069 AJ screenees, 524 GD carriers (1:15) and 9 previously unrecognized GD homozygotes (1:897) were identified, consistent with the rate expected (1:949; P > .99). Six of these homozygotes and 31 AJ GD homozygotes identified by other prenatal carrier screening programs in the New York City metropolitan area were evaluated (age range of the homozygotes, 17-40 years). Of these, 84% were N370S homozygotes, others being heteroallelic for N370S and V394L, L444P, or R496H mutations. Notably, 65% reported no GD medical complaints. However, 49% had anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Among the 29 who had imaging studies, 97% had mild to moderate splenomegaly and 55% had hepatomegaly; skeletal imaging revealed marrow infiltration (100%), Erlenmeyer flask deformities (43%), lucencies (22%), and bone infarcts (14%). Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry studies of 25 homozygotes found 60% with osteopenia or osteoporosis. Contrary to previous discussions, almost all asymptomatic GD homozygotes serendipitously diagnosed by prenatal carrier screening had disease manifestations and should be followed for disease progression and institution of appropriate medical treatment.

Homozygous nonsense mutations in TWIST2 cause Setleis syndrome.
The focal facial dermal dysplasias (FFDDs) are a group of inherited developmental disorders in which the characteristic diagnostic feature is bitemporal scar-like lesions that resemble forceps marks. To date, the genetic defects underlying these ectodermal dysplasias have not been determined. To identify the gene defect causing autosomal-recessive Setleis syndrome (type III FFDD), homozygosity mapping was performed with genomic DNAs from five affected individuals and 26 members of the consanguineous Puerto Rican (PR) family originally described by Setleis and colleagues. Microsatellites D2S1397 and D2S2968 were homozygous in all affected individuals, mapping the disease locus to 2q37.3. Haplotype analyses of additional markers in the PR family and a consanguineous Arab family further limited the disease locus to approximately 3 Mb between D2S2949 and D2S2253. Of the 29 candidate genes in this region, the bHLH transcription factor, TWIST2, was initially sequenced on the basis of its known involvement in murine facial development. Homozygous TWIST2 nonsense mutations, c.324C>T and c.486C>T, were identified in the affected members of the Arab and PR families, respectively. Characterization of the expressed mutant proteins, p.Q65X and p.Q119X, by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and immunoblot analyses indicated that they were truncated and unstable. Notably, Setleis syndrome patients and Twist2 knockout mice have similar facial features, indicating the gene's conserved role in mammalian development. Although human TWIST2 and TWIST1 encode highly homologous bHLH transcription factors, the finding that TWIST2 recessive mutations cause an FFDD and dominant TWIST1 mutations cause Saethre-Chotzen craniocynostosis suggests that they function independently in skin and bone development.

Amniotic fluid cells are more efficiently reprogrammed to pluripotency than adult cells.
Recently, cultured human adult skin cells were reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which have characteristics similar to human embryonic stem (hES) cells. Patient-derived iPS cells offer genetic and immunologic advantages for cell and tissue replacement or engineering. The efficiency of generating human iPS cells has been very low; therefore an easily and efficiently reprogrammed cell type is highly desired. Here, we demonstrate that terminally differentiated human amniotic fluid (AF) skin cells provide an accessible source for efficiently generating abundant-induced pluripotent stem (AF-iPS) cells. By induction of pluripotency with the transcription factor quartet (OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC) the terminally differentiated, cultured AF skin cells formed iPS colonies approximately twice as fast and yielded nearly a two-hundred percent increase in number, compared to cultured adult skin cells. AF-iPS cells were identical to hES cells for morphological and growth characteristics, antigenic stem cell markers, stem cell gene expression, telomerase activity, in vitro and in vivo differentiation into the three germ layers and for their capacity to form embryoid bodies (EBs) and teratomas. Our findings provide a biological interesting conclusion that these fetal AF cells are more rapidly, easily, and efficiently reprogrammed to pluripotency than neonatal and adult cells. AF-iPS cells may have a "young," more embryonic like epigenetic background, which may facilitate and accelerate pluripotency. The ability to efficiently and rapidly reprogram terminally differentiated AF skin cells and generate induced pluripotent stem cells provides an abundant iPS cell source for various basic studies and a potential for future patient-specific personalized therapies.

Experience with carrier screening and prenatal diagnosis for 16 Ashkenazi Jewish genetic diseases.
The success of prenatal carrier screening as a disease prevention strategy in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population has driven the expansion of screening panels as disease-causing founder mutations have been identified. However, the carrier frequencies of many of these mutations have not been reported in large AJ cohorts. We determined the carrier frequencies of over 100 mutations for 16 recessive disorders in the New York metropolitan area AJ population. Among the 100% AJ-descended individuals, screening for 16 disorders resulted in ?1 in 3.3 being a carrier for one disease and ?1 in 24 for two diseases. The carrier frequencies ranged from 0.066 (1 in 15.2; Gaucher disease) to 0.006 (1 in 168; nemaline myopathy), which averaged ?15% higher than those for all screenees. Importantly, over 95% of screenees chose to be screened for all possible AJ diseases, including disorders with lower carrier frequencies and/or detectability. Carrier screening also identified rare individuals homozygous for disease-causing mutations who had previously unrecognized clinical manifestations. Additionally, prenatal testing results and experience for all 16 disorders (n = 574) are reported. Together, these data indicate the general acceptance, carrier frequencies, and prenatal testing results for an expanded panel of 16 diseases in the AJ population.

Combined CYP2C9, VKORC1 and CYP4F2 frequencies among racial and ethnic groups.
CYP4F2*3 (p.V433M) has been associated with higher warfarin dose requirements; however, its frequency, like other CYP2C9 and VKORC1 variants, has not been systematically assessed in major racial/ethnic populations. Thus, we determined the individual and combined frequencies of important CYP2C9, VKORC1 and CYP4F2 variants in several racial/ethnic groups. Healthy African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic and Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) blood donors were genotyped for CYP2C9 (*2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *8, *11 and *13), VKORC1 (g.-1639G>A) and CYP4F2 (*3 [p.V433M] and rs2189784). The combined frequencies of variant CYP2C9 alleles were 0.133, 0.078, 0.212, 0.178 and 0.212 among African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic and AJ individuals, respectively. CYP4F2*3 frequencies were prevalent (0.233-0.342) among Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic and AJ individuals, while significantly less frequent among African-Americans (0.117; p < 0.0001). In addition, CYP4F2*3 was in linkage disequilibrium with rs2189784, an allele recently associated with time-to-therapeutic international normalized ratio, among all studied populations. Importantly, 87-95% of Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic and AJ individuals had a variant CYP2C9, VKORC1 and/or CYP4F2*3 allele, compared with only 53% of African-Americans (p < 0.0001). Compared with other racial/ethnic populations studied, only approximately one in 80 African-Americans were CYP4F2*3 homozygous, indicating that this population would benefit less from dosing algorithms that include this variant. In addition, the unique allele frequency profiles identified among the different populations partly explain why genotype-guided warfarin dosing algorithms perform less well for African-Americans and suggest that other unidentified genetic and/or nongenetic factors that influence warfarin dosage may exist in this population.

Feline congenital erythropoietic porphyria: two homozygous UROS missense mutations cause the enzyme deficiency and porphyrin accumulation.
The first feline model of human congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) due to deficient uroporphyrinogen III synthase (URO-synthase) activity was identified by its characteristic clinical phenotype, and confirmed by biochemical and molecular genetic studies. The proband, an adult domestic shorthair cat, had dark-red urine and brownish discolored teeth with red fluorescence under ultraviolet light. Biochemical studies demonstrated markedly increased uroporphyrinogen I in urine and plasma (2,650- and 10,700-fold greater than wild type, respectively), whereas urinary 5-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen were lower than normal. Erythrocytic URO-synthase activity was <1% of mean wild-type activity, confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing it from feline phenocopies having acute intermittent porphyria. Sequencing of the affected cat's UROS gene revealed two missense mutations, c.140C>T (p.S47F) in exon 3 and c.331G>A (p.G111S) in exon 6, both of which were homozygous, presumably owing to parental consanguinity. Neither was present in 100 normal cat alleles. Prokaryotic expression and thermostability studies of the purified monomeric wild-type, p.S47F, p.G111S, and p.S47F/G111S enzymes showed that the p.S47F enzyme had 100% of wild-type specific activity but ~50% decreased thermostability, whereas the p.G111S and p.S47F/G111S enzymes had about 60% and 20% of wild-type specific activity, respectively, and both were markedly thermolabile. Molecular modeling results indicated that the less active/less stable p.G111S enzyme was further functionally impaired by a structural interaction induced by the presence of the S47F substitution. Thus, the synergistic interaction of two rare amino acid substitutions in the URO-synthase polypeptide caused the feline model of human CEP.

Detection of low-level mosaicism and placental mosaicism by oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization.
To determine the sensitivity of whole-genome oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization for the detection of mosaic cytogenetic abnormalities. Mosaicism sensitivity was evaluated by testing artificially derived whole chromosome and segmental aneuploidies ranging from 0% to 100% abnormal and additional naturally occurring mosaic specimens. Using combined dye-reversed replicates and an unfiltered analysis, oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization detected as low as 10% and 20-30% mosaicism from whole chromosome and segmental aneuploidies, respectively. To investigate discrepancies between cultured and uncultured specimens, array comparative genomic hybridization was performed on DNA from additional direct product of conception specimens with abnormal karyotypes in culture. Interestingly, 5 of 10 product of conception specimens with double trisomies on cultured cell analysis had only a single trisomy by array comparative genomic hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction on DNA from the uncultured direct specimen, and all harbored the more commonly observed trisomy. Thus, oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization revealed previously unidentified placental mosaicism in half of the products of conception with double-aneuploid conventional karyotypes. Oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization can detect low-level mosaicism for whole chromosome ( approximately 10%) and segmental ( approximately 20-30%) aneuploidies when using specific detection criteria. In addition, careful interpretation is required when performing array comparative genomic hybridization on DNA isolated from direct specimens as the results may differ from the cultured chromosome analysis.

Congenital erythropoietic porphyria: a novel uroporphyrinogen III synthase branchpoint mutation reveals underlying wild-type alternatively spliced transcripts.
Splicing mutations account for approximately 10% of lesions causing genetic diseases, but few branchpoint sequence (BPS) lesions have been reported. In 3 families with autosomal recessive congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) resulting from uroporphyrinogen III synthase (URO-synthase) deficiency, sequencing the promoter, all 10 exons and the intron/exon boundaries did not detect a mutation. Northern analyses of lymphoblast mRNAs from 2 patients and reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of lymphoblast mRNAs from all 3 patients revealed multiple longer transcripts involving intron 9 and low levels of wild-type message. Sequencing intron 9 RT-PCR products and genomic DNA in each case revealed homozygosity for a novel BPS mutation (c.661-31T-->G) and alternatively spliced transcripts containing 81, 246, 358, and 523 nucleotides from intron 9. RT-PCR revealed aberrant transcripts in both wild-type and CEP lymphoblasts, whereas BPS mutation reduced the wild-type transcript and enzyme activity in CEP lymphoblasts to approximately 10% and 15% of normal, respectively. Although the +81-nucleotide alternative transcript was in-frame, it only contributed approximately 0.2% of the lymphoblast URO-synthase activity. Thus, the BPS mutation markedly reduced the wild-type transcript and enzyme activity, thereby causing the disease. This is the first BPS mutation in the last intron, presumably accounting for the observed 100% intron retention without exon skipping.

Feline acute intermittent porphyria: a phenocopy masquerading as an erythropoietic porphyria due to dominant and recessive hydroxymethylbilane synthase mutations.
Human acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), the most common acute hepatic porphyria, is an autosomal dominant inborn error of heme biosynthesis due to the half-normal activity of hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMB-synthase). Here, we describe the first naturally occurring animal model of AIP in four unrelated cat lines who presented phenotypically as congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP). Affected cats had erythrodontia, brownish urine, fluorescent bones, and markedly elevated urinary uroporphyrin (URO) and coproporphyrin (COPRO) consistent with CEP. However, their uroporphyrinogen-III-synthase (URO-synthase) activities (deficient in CEP) were normal. Notably, affected cats had half-normal HMB-synthase activities and elevated urinary 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), the deficient enzyme and accumulated metabolites in human AIP. Sequencing the feline HMB-synthase gene revealed different mutations in each line: a duplication (c.189dupT), an in-frame 3 bp deletion (c.842_844delGAG) identical to that causing human AIP and two missense mutations, c.250G>A (p.A84T) and c.445C>T (p.R149W). Prokaryotic expression of mutations c.842_844delGAG and c.445C>T resulted in mutant enzymes with <1% wild-type activity, whereas c.250G>A expressed a stable enzyme with approximately 35% of wild-type activity. The discolored teeth from the affected cats contained markedly elevated URO I and III, accounting for the CEP-like phenocopy. In three lines, the phenotype was an autosomal dominant trait, while affected cats with the c.250G>A (p.A84T) mutation were homozygous, a unique recessive form of AIP. These animal models may permit further investigation of the pathogenesis of the acute, life-threatening neurological attacks in human AIP and the evaluation of therapeutic strategies.

AAV8-mediated gene therapy prevents induced biochemical attacks of acute intermittent porphyria and improves neuromotor function.
Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), an autosomal dominant hepatic porphyria due to half-normal hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMB-synthase) activity, is manifested by life-threatening acute neurological attacks that are precipitated by factors that induce heme biosynthesis. The acute attacks are currently treated with intravenous hemin, but a more continuous therapy is needed, particularly for patients experiencing frequent attacks. Thus, a recombinant AAV8-based serotype vector expressing murine HMB-synthase driven by liver-specific regulatory elements was generated and its effectiveness to prevent the biochemical induction of an acute attack was evaluated in an AIP mouse model. Intraperitoneal administration of the adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector resulted in a rapid and dose-dependent increase of HMB-synthase activity that was restricted to the liver. Stable expression of hepatic HMB-synthase was achieved and wild-type or greater levels were sustained for 36 weeks. When heme synthesis was periodically induced by a series of phenobarbital injections, the treated mice did not accumulate urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) or porphobilinogen (PBG), indicating that the expressed enzyme was functional in vivo and prevented induction of the acute attack. Further, rotarod performance and footprint analyses improved significantly. Thus, liver-directed gene therapy provided successful long-term correction of the hepatic metabolic abnormalities and improved neuromotor function in the murine model of human AIP.

Use of complementary and alternative medicine by patients with lysosomal storage diseases.
To evaluate the extent of complementary and alternative medicine use and perceived effectiveness in patients with lysosomal storage diseases. A 26-item survey was distributed to 495 patients with type 1 Gaucher, Fabry, and type B Niemann-Pick diseases who were seen at the Lysosomal Storage Disease Program at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Survey responses were entered into an access database and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Surveys were completed by 167 respondents with an overall response rate of 34%. Complementary and alternative medicines were used by 45% of patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, 41% of patients with Fabry disease, and 47% of patients with type B Niemann-Pick for symptoms related to their disease. Complementary and alternative medicines were used most frequently by adult females (55%), in patients who reported having one or more invasive procedures due to their disease, patients who use one or more conventional medical therapies, or those with depression and/or anxiety. Overall perceived effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine supplements was low; however, complementary and alternative medicine therapies were perceived as effective. Complementary and alternative medicines are commonly used among patients with lysosomal storage diseases. Assessment of the effectiveness of these approaches in the lysosomal storage diseases is needed, and physicians should be aware of complementary and alternative medicine therapies used by patients to evaluate safety and possible drug interactions.

CYP2C9*8 is prevalent among African-Americans: implications for pharmacogenetic dosing.
Although the frequencies of pharmacogenetic variants differ among racial groups, most pharmacogenetic algorithms for genotype-guided warfarin dosing only include two CYP2C9 alleles (*2 and *3) and a single VKORC1 allele (g.-1639G>A or g.1173C>T) commonly found among Caucasians. Therefore, this study sought to identify other CYP2C9 and VKORC1 alleles important in warfarin dose variability and to determine their frequencies in different racial and ethnic groups. The CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes were sequenced in selected sensitive (< 21 mg/week) and resistant (> 49 mg/week) individuals with discrepant therapeutic and algorithm-predicted warfarin doses based on prior CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotyping. The CYP2C9 and VKORC1 allele frequencies were determined in healthy, racially self-identified blood donors. Sequencing identified an African-American male with a lower than predicted therapeutic warfarin dose (14.4 mg/week), previously genotyped as CYP2C9*1/*1, who was homozygous for CYP2C9*8 (c.449G>A; p.R150H). Genotyping 600 African-American alleles identified CYP2C9*8 as their most frequent variant CYP2C9 allele (0.047), and the combined allele frequency of CYP2C9*2, *3, *5, *6, *8 and *11 was 0.133. Given most warfarin pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms only include CYP2C9*2 and *3, the inclusion of CYP2C9*8 alone could reclassify the predicted metabolic phenotypes of almost 10% of African-Americans, or when combined with CYP2C9*5, *6 and *11, more than 15%. In addition, the African-American VKORC1 g.-1639A allele frequency was 0.108 and three g.1331G>A (p.V66M) carriers were identified. CYP2C9*8 is prevalent among African-Americans ( approximately 1 in 11 individuals). Thus, in this racial group, the incorporation of CYP2C9*8 into genotyping panels may improve dose prediction of CYP2C9-metabolized drugs, including warfarin.

Warfarin pharmacogenetics: CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes predict different sensitivity and resistance frequencies in the Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jewish populations.
Warfarin is a widely used anticoagulant that has a narrow therapeutic range because of both genetic and environmental factors. CYP2C9( *)2 (p.R144C), CYP2C9( *)3 (p.I359L), and the VKORC1 promoter (g.-1639G-->A) polymorphisms occur frequently in patients who are warfarin "sensitive" and require lower doses, whereas patients with VKORC1 missense mutations are warfarin "resistant" and require higher doses. To compare the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 allele and genotype frequencies among 260 Ashkenazi (AJ) and 80 Sephardi Jewish (SJ) individuals, we genotyped six CYP2C9 and eight VKORC1 alleles by using the Tag-It Mutation Detection Kit and PCR-RFLP assays. The "sensitive"CYP2C9( *)2 and ( *)3 alleles had significantly higher frequencies in SJ than in AJ individuals, 0.194 and 0.144 versus 0.127 and 0.081, respectively (p <or= 0.001). In contrast, the VKORC1 p.D36Y mutation, which predicts warfarin "resistance," had a significantly higher frequency in AJ than in SJ individuals, 0.043 versus 0.006, respectively (p <or= 0.025). Of note, 11.3% of AJ individuals predicted to be CYP2C9 extensive metabolizers and 8.7% of those predicted to be intermediate and poor metabolizers were VKORC1 p.D36Y carriers who require markedly higher warfarin doses. Thus, approximately 10% of all AJ individuals would be misclassified when only genotyping CYP2C9( *)2, ( *)3, and VKORC1 g.-1639G-->A, underscoring the importance of screening for p.D36Y prior to initiating warfarin anticoagulation in AJ individuals. Taken together, our findings show that approximately 85% of AJ and approximately 90% of SJ individuals have at least one "sensitive" (CYP2C9( *)2, ( *)3, VKORC1 g.-1639G-->A) or "resistant" (VKORC1 p.D36Y) allele, indicating that each group has different warfarin pharmacogenetics and would benefit from genotype-based dose predictions.

CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 allele frequencies in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.
To determine and compare the cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 allele and genotype frequencies in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population with other populations. CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genotypes were determined in 250 anonymous, unrelated, healthy AJ individuals from the greater New York (USA) metropolitan area. Genotyping was performed using the Tag-Ittrade mark Mutation Detection system and the recently redefined CYP2D6*41A allele was identified by a restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Among the 250 AJ individuals, the CYP2C9*1, *2, *3 and *5 allele frequencies were 0.772, 0.140, 0.086 and 0.002, respectively, and the genotypes were distributed into extensive- (60.8%), intermediate- (32.8%) and poor- (6.4%) metabolizer phenotypes. The CYP2C19*1, *2 and *4 allele frequencies were 0.830, 0.152 and 0.018, respectively, and the genotypes were distributed into extensive (69.2%), intermediate (27.6%) and poor (3.2%) metabolizers. The most common CYP2D6 alleles identified were *1, *2A, *4 and *41A, and their frequencies were 0.286 0.152 0.226 and 0.140, respectively. The CYP2D6 genotypes were distributed into ultrarapid- (8.8%), extensive- (70.0%), intermediate- (16.0%) and poor- (5.2%) metabolizer phenotypes. Although the CYP2C9 allele and genotype frequencies in the AJ subjects were similar to those in other North American Caucasian populations, genotyping the CYP2C19*4 and CYP2D6*41A alleles in the AJ population resulted in the clinically relevant reclassification of the predicted metabolizer phenotypes. Inclusion of CYP2C19*4 reclassified individuals from either extensive- or intermediate- to the intermediate- or poor-metabolizer phenotypes, respectively. Inclusion of the redefined CYP2D6*41A allele increased the ultrarapid-, intermediate- and poor-metabolizer phenotype combined frequencies to 30%, indicating that approximately one in three AJ individuals may benefit from genotype-based drug selection and dosage. In addition, the ultrarapid CYP2D6 genotype frequency in the AJ population (8.8%) was approximately twofold higher than that in other North American Caucasians.

Human uroporphyrinogen III synthase: NMR-based mapping of the active site.
Uroporphyrinogen III synthase (URO-synthase) catalyzes the cyclization and D-ring isomerization of hydroxymethylbilane (HMB) to uroporphyrinogen (URO'gen) III, the cyclic tetrapyrrole and physiologic precursor of heme, chlorophyl, and corrin. The deficient activity of human URO-synthase results in the autosomal recessive cutaneous disorder, congenital erythropoietic porphyria. Mapping of the structural determinants that specify catalysis and, potentially, protein-protein interactions is lacking. To map the active site and assess the enzyme's possible interaction in a complex with hydroxymethylbilane-synthase (HMB-synthase) and/or uroporphyrinogen-decarboxylase (URO-decarboxylase) by NMR, an efficient expression and purification procedure was developed for these cytosolic enzymes of heme biosynthesis that enabled preparation of special isotopically-labeled protein samples for NMR characterization. Using an 800 MHz instrument, assignment of the URO-synthase backbone (13)C(alpha) (100%), (1)H(alpha) (99.6%), and nonproline (1)H(N) and (15)N resonances (94%) was achieved as well as 85% of the side-chain (13)C and (1)H resonances. NMR analyses of URO-synthase titrated with competitive inhibitors N(D)-methyl-1-formylbilane (NMF-bilane) or URO'gen III, revealed resonance perturbations of specific residues lining the cleft between the two major domains of URO synthase that mapped the enzyme's active site. In silico docking of the URO-synthase crystal structure with NMF-bilane and URO'gen III was consistent with the perturbation results and provided a 3D model of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. The absence of chemical shift changes in the (15)N spectrum of URO-synthase mixed with the homogeneous HMB-synthase holoenzyme or URO-decarboxylase precluded occurrence of a stable cytosolic enzyme complex.

Acute intermittent porphyria: vector optimization for gene therapy.
Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by the half-normal activity of hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMB-synthase). Affected individuals can experience episodic, life-threatening, acute neurological attacks that are precipitated by various drugs, dieting, and hormonal changes. Intravenous hematin is used to treat the attacks, but a more effective, preventive therapy is needed, especially for patients with frequent attacks. Since the disease is a hepatic encephalopathy, efforts were focused towards evaluating four different combinations of liver-specific enhancers and promoters for maximal hepatic HMB-synthase expression. Four different mammalian expression vectors, each carrying a unique combination of liver-specific enhancers and promoters driving murine HMB-synthase cDNA expression, were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells. The vectors included: HMBS-1; human alpha1-microglobulin enhancer/alpha1-antityrpsin promoter (alpha1Me/alpha1ATp), HMBS-2; alpha1Me/human serum albumin promoter (alpha1Me/SAp), HMBS-3; human prothrombin enhancer/SAp (PTe/SAp), and HMBS-4; (PTe/alpha1ATp). Each HMB-synthase construct and a luciferase reporter construct were hydrodynamically coinjected into mice with HMB-synthase deficiency and evaluated for hepatic expression 24 h post-injection, the time-point of peak hepatic HMB-synthase expression. Following transient transfection into HepG2 cells, HMBS-1 (alpha1Me/alpha1ATp) had the highest HMB-synthase expression level, with an approximately 8-fold increase over endogenous cellular activities. Construct HMBS-1 also had the highest hepatic HMB-synthase activity following hydrodynamic delivery into HMB-synthase deficient mice, with a approximately 6-fold increase over saline-treated mice. These studies support the use of a gene therapy vector containing the alpha1Me/alpha1ATp combination for preclinical studies of the efficacy and safety of liver-targeted gene therapy for AIP.

Type 1 Gaucher disease: null and hypomorphic novel chitotriosidase mutations-implications for diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring.
Human plasma chitotriosidase (Chito) is a useful diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker for Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD). However, approximately 40% of Caucasians are heterozygous or homozygous for a common null mutation, c.1049_1072dup24 (dup24) in the chitotriosidase gene (chitinase 1, CHIT1), that complicates interpretation for heterozygotes and precludes use for null homozygotes. 320 Type 1 GD patients were screened for CHIT1 genotype and plasma Chito enzyme levels; 37% were heterozygous and 4% were homozygous for the CHIT1 dup24 allele. Four patients who had no or very low plasma Chito activities had wild-type (wt)/dup24 or wt/wt CHIT1 genotypes, suggesting the presence of other mutations. Sequencing their CHIT1 genes revealed three novel mutations: p.E74K (E74K), p.G102S (G102S), and a complex exon 10 lesion (c.[1060G>A; 1155G>A; 1156+5_1156+8delGTAA], p.[G354R; L385L; missplicing], designated "complex E/I-10"). The G102S mutation was common in Type 1 GD patients and controls ( approximately 30% of alleles). In contrast, the E74K mutation was rare, present only in three Type 1 GD patients ( approximately 1% of alleles), all of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) descent, but it was not found in normal controls. The complex E/I-10 mutation occurred in two Caribbean Hispanic/African Type 1 GD patients and was present in 0 to 6% of alleles among normal controls from different populations. In vitro expression demonstrated that the E74K and G102S alleles had approximately 51% and approximately 23% of wild-type Chito catalytic efficiency, respectively. Expression of the G354R allele alone or with the L385L silent substitution did not produce detectable Chito activity or protein. RNA studies indicated that the complex E/I-10 allele also caused missplicing. Recognition of these mutations, particularly G102S, will facilitate the use and interpretation of plasma Chito activities for disease diagnosis, estimating disease severity, and monitoring therapeutic efficacy in GD.

Fabry disease: clinical spectrum and evidence-based enzyme replacement therapy.
The clinical spectrum of Fabry disease, an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder due to alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) deficiency, has been expanded beyond the classic phenotype to include the recently recognized later-onset "cardiac" and "renal" variants. The clinical manifestations in each of these disease subtypes are presented with particular emphasis on early recognition among pediatric patients as well as identification of unrecognized patients diagnosed as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or in renal dialysis clinics. Previously, treatment of patients with Fabry disease was limited to palliative care of the excruciating pain, cardiac and cerebrovascular manifestations, and renal failure. Recently, Fabry-specific enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant alpha-Gal A (Fabrazyme) has proven safe and effective. The preclinical, Phase 1/2 and multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 and 4 trials provided the evidence for the safety and efficacy of Fabrazyme treatment. The preclinical and Phase 1/2 studies demonstrated that enzyme delivery to various tissues and GL-3 clearance were dose-dependent. The Phase 3 clinical trial and 3-year extension study provided long-term data documenting the safety and effectiveness of 1 mg/kg of Fabrazyme for this disease. Finally, the "top-line" data from the Phase 4 trial indicates that in patients with mildly to moderately advanced renal disease, Fabrazyme can slow the progression of renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular events taken together or individually. The Phase 4 trial results also emphasize the importance of early treatment. In sum, these clinical trials provide the evidence-based safety and efficacy of Fabrazyme replacement therapy for Fabry disease.

Agalsidase-beta therapy for advanced Fabry disease: a randomized trial.
Fabry disease (alpha-galactosidase A deficiency) is a rare, X-linked lysosomal storage disorder that can cause early death from renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular involvement. To see whether agalsidase beta delays the onset of a composite clinical outcome of renal, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular events and death in patients with advanced Fabry disease. Randomized (2:1 treatment-to-placebo randomization), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 41 referral centers in 9 countries. 82 adults with mild to moderate kidney disease; 74 of whom were protocol-adherent. Intravenous infusion of agalsidase beta (1 mg per kg of body weight) or placebo every 2 weeks for up to 35 months (median, 18.5 months). The primary end point was the time to first clinical event (renal, cardiac, or cerebrovascular event or death). Six patients withdrew before reaching an end point: 3 to receive commercial therapy and 3 due to positive or inconclusive serum IgE or skin test results. Three patients assigned to agalsidase beta elected to transition to open-label treatment before reaching an end point. Thirteen (42%) of the 31 patients in the placebo group and 14 (27%) of the 51 patients in the agalsidase-beta group experienced clinical events. Primary intention-to-treat analysis that adjusted for an imbalance in baseline proteinuria showed that, compared with placebo, agalsidase beta delayed the time to first clinical event (hazard ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.21 to 1.03]; P = 0.06). Secondary analyses of protocol-adherent patients showed similar results (hazard ratio, 0.39 [CI, 0.16 to 0.93]; P = 0.034). Ancillary subgroup analyses found larger treatment effects in patients with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rates greater than 55 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (hazard ratio, 0.19 [CI, 0.05 to 0.82]; P = 0.025) compared with 55 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or less (hazard ratio, 0.85 [CI, 0.32 to 2.3]; P = 0.75) (formal test for interaction, P = 0.09). Most treatment-related adverse events were mild or moderate infusion-associated reactions, reported by 55% of patients in the agalsidase-beta group and 23% of patients in the placebo group. The study sample was small. Only one third of the patients experienced clinical events, and some patients withdrew before experiencing any event. Agalsidase-beta therapy slowed progression to the composite clinical outcome of renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular complications and death compared with placebo in patients with advanced Fabry disease. Therapeutic intervention before irreversible organ damage may provide greater clinical benefit.

Identification of CYP2C19*4B: pharmacogenetic implications for drug metabolism including clopidogrel responsiveness.
CYP2C19 is a principal enzyme involved in the bioactivation of the antiplatelet prodrug clopidogrel and common CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles are associated with adverse cardiovascular events. To assess the impact of the CYP2C19*17 increased activity allele in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) and Sephardi Jewish (SJ) populations and to determine the frequencies of additional variant alleles, 250 AJ and 135 SJ individuals were genotyped for CYP2C19*2-*10, *12-*17, *22 and P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) c.3435C>T. Importantly, CYP2C19*4, a loss-of-function allele, was identified in linkage disequilibrium with *17. This novel haplotype, designated CYP2C19*4B, significantly alters the interpretation of CYP2C19 genotyping when testing *17. Moreover, genotyping CYP2C19*17 changed the frequency of extensive metabolizers from ?70 to ?40%, reclassifying ?30% as ultrarapid metabolizers. Combining CYP2C19 and ABCB1 identified ?1 in 3 AJ and ?1 in 2 SJ individuals at increased risk for adverse responses to clopidogrel. These data underscore the importance of including *4B and *17 when clinically genotyping CYP2C19.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 1 March 2011; doi:10.1038/tpj.2011.5.

Comparative performance of gene-based warfarin dosing algorithms in a multiethnic population.
Gene-based warfarin dosing algorithms have largely been developed in homogeneous populations, and their generalizability has not been established. We sought to assess the performance of published algorithms in a racially diverse and multiethnic sample, and determine if additional clinical variables or genetic variants associated with dose could enhance algorithm performance. In 145 compliant patients on warfarin with a goal international normalized ratio (INR) of 2-3, stable, therapeutic doses were compared with predicted doses using 12 reported algorithms that incorporated CYP2C9 and VKORC1 variants. Additional covariates tested with each model included race, concurrent medications, medications known to interact with warfarin and previously described CYP4F2, CALU and GGCX variants. The mean patient age was 67 +/- 14 years; 90 (62%) were male. Eighty-two (57%) were Caucasian, 28 (19%) African-American, 20 (14%) Hispanic and 15 (10%) Asian. The median warfarin dose was 35 mg per week (interquartile range 23-53 mg per week). Gene-based dosing algorithms explained 37-55% of the variation in warfarin dose requirements. Neither the addition of race, number of concurrent medications nor the number of concurrent medications interacting with warfarin enhanced algorithm performance. Similarly, consideration of CYP4F2, CALU or GGCX variant genotypes did not improve algorithms. Existing gene-based dosing algorithms explained between approximately one-third and one-half of the variability in warfarin dose requirements in this racially and ethnically diverse cohort. Additional clinical and recently described genetic variants associated with warfarin dose did not enhance prediction in our patient population.
