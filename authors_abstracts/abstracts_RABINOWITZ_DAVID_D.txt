Ectopic Glandular Breast Tissue in a Lactating Young Woman.
BACKGROUND: Ectopic breast tissue is a rare occurrence in pregnant women and should not be confused with abscess or other causes. Ectopic breast tissue is present at birth but often only diagnosed after puberty, pregnancy, or lactation. OBJECTIVE: Misdiagnosis is of concern due to the fact that ectopic breast tissue may undergo pathological changes with increased risk of malignancy. Therefore, it is vital for emergency physicians to be able to recognize this process and ensure proper follow-up care. CASE REPORT: We present a case of ectopic breast tissue in a 19-year-old primigravida. CONCLUSION: Surgical removal for the purpose of prophylaxis of malignant changes is not currently recommended. Definitive diagnosis is established by fine-needle aspiration and excisional biopsy.
