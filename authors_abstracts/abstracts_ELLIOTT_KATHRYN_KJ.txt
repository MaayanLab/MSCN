HIV-related neurocognitive impairment in the HAART era.
Neurocognitive impairment is common in people living with HIV and AIDS. Prior to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), cognitive impairment primarily affected patients with advanced disease, and was a more rapidly progressive illness. With the use of HAART, cognitive impairment improved, along with the overall health of HIV-positive patients. However, it is still a prevalent problem, even in patients with desirable CD4+ count and undetectable plasma viral load. In this review, we address the nature of HIV-related neurocognitive impairment in the HAART era, including its etiology, pathology, appropriate diagnostic tools for clinical practice and research, and rational treatment approaches.
