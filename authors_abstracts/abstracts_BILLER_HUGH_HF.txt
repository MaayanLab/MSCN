Free tissue transfer for skull base reconstruction analysis of complications and a classification scheme for defining skull base defects.
The role of free flaps in skull base reconstruction is discussed in detail. Twenty-six microvascular free tissue transfers performed in 22 patients are reviewed in detail. A classification scheme for skull base defects is presented. Tertiary referral center. Twenty-two patients with neoplasms that involve the skull base underwent a combined craniotomy and facial approach for resection. The resultant defects were reconstructed with a variety of microvascular free flaps. All 22 patients were ultimately successfully reconstructed with a free flap. One patient required a second free flap following ablative surgery for a recurrent tumor. The initial free flaps in three patients were unsuccessful and a second flap was required. The classification scheme was applied to all defects. The creation of a functional separation of the intracranial and extracranial cavities can be extremely difficult to accomplish, especially when multiple cavities (nasal, oral, pharyngeal) are violated. Free flaps provide a solution to this problem in select cases. Skull base defects can and should be classified for the purpose of communication, treatment planning, prognosis of reconstruction, and judging therapeutic outcome.
