Adalimumab-induced acute pneumonitis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.
Interstitial lung disease is one of the most common and severe extra-articular manifestations associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Previous to the biologic treatment era, methotrexate was the medication known to cause acute lung disease mostly in patients with preexisting rheumatoid lung disease. However, recent case reports of patients treated with biologic therapies show an increased incidence of acute lung disease caused by tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors. This case will illustrate acute lung disease caused by adalimumab, a recombinant IgG1 monoclonal antibody. The rheumatology community must be aware of this adverse effect described so far with all 3 major tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors, before starting but also during maintenance therapy.
