The first decade of a laparoscopic donor nephrectomy program: effect of surgeon and institution experience with 512 cases from 1996 to 2006.
Although the procedure is generally safe, significant morbidity and even mortality have occurred after laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN). The learning curves for both surgeons and institutions with LDN have not been well delineated, and longterm donor data are not well reported. A retrospective study of the initial 512 patients undergoing LDN performed at Mount Sinai Medical Center between October 1996 and March 2006 was performed. Intraoperative and immediate postoperative surgical outcomes were reviewed. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify predictors of outcomes, including the experience level of individual surgeons and of the institution. Longitudinal followup data of donor patients between 1 month and 9 years were obtained. Mean donor age was 39.2 years, and 54.6% of patients were women. Left kidneys were procured in 84.0%. Operative time averaged 215.2 minutes, and warm ischemia time, 166.6 seconds. The conversion rate was 1.4%, and hand-assistance was used in 49.9%. The intraoperative complication rate was 5.5%, 30-day complication rate 9.4%, and 1.4% of patients required reoperation. Immediate graft survival was 97.1%, acute tubular necrosis occurred in 8.5%, and delayed graft function in 3.7%. At a mean followup of 37.2 months, delayed donor complications were infrequent, but included chronic pain, hypertension, incisional hernia, and small bowel obstruction. Although individual surgeons and our institution gained experience, operative and warm ischemia times decreased significantly, but complication rates were unchanged. Although a learning curve was discovered for operative time and warm ischemia time, excellent results can be achieved during the early experience of both surgeons and institutions with LDN, and maintained over time. Younger, female, and nonobese donors were associated with fewer complications. Longterm donor morbidity is uncommon, but mandates better followup.

MRI estimation of total renal volume demonstrates significant association with healthy donor weight.
The purpose of this study was to correlate total renal volume (TRV) calculations, obtained through the voxel-count method and ellipsoid formula with various physical characteristics. MRI reports and physical examination from 210 healthy kidney donors (420 kidneys), on whom renal volumes were obtained using the voxel-count method, were retrospectively reviewed. These values along with ones obtained through a more traditional method (ellipsoid formula) were correlated with subject height, body weight, body mass index (BMI), and age. TRV correlated strongly with body weight (r=0.7) and to a lesser degree with height, age, or BMI (r=0.5, -0.2, 0.3, respectively). The left kidney volume was greater than the right, on average (p<0.001). The ellipsoid formula method over-estimated renal volume by 17% on average which was significant (p<0.001). Body weight was the physical characteristic which demonstrated the strongest correlation with renal volume in healthy subjects. Given this finding, a formula was derived for estimating the TRV for a given patient based on the his or her weight: TRV = 2.96 x weight (kg) + 113+/-64.

Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy: intraoperative safety, immediate morbidity, and delayed complications with 500 cases.
Several large series of laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) have been published, largely focusing on immediate results and short-term complications. The aim of this study was to examine the results of LDN and collect medium-term and long-term donor followup. We examined the results of two surgeons who performed 500 consecutive LDNs from 1996 to 2005. Prospective databases were reviewed for both donors and recipients to record demographics, medical history, intraoperative events, and complications. Patients were followed between 1 month and 9 years after surgery to assess for delayed complications, especially hypertension, renal insufficiency, incisional hernia, bowel obstruction, and chronic pain. Left kidneys were procured in 86.2% of cases. Mean operative time was 3.5 h, and warm ischemia time averaged 3.4 min. Hand-assistance was used in 13.8%, and conversion rate was 1.8%. Intraoperative complication rate was 5.8% and was predominantly bleeding (93.1%). Most (86.2%) of the operative complications occurred during the initial 150 cases of a surgeon, compared with 10.3% in the subsequent 150 cases (p = 0.003). Operative time decreased by 87 min after the initial 150 cases (p < 0.001). Immediate graft survival was 97.5%. Delayed graft function occurred in 3.0% of recipients, and acute tubular necrosis occurred in 7.0%. Thirty-day donor complication rate was 9.8%. Mean donor creatinine was 1.24 on the first postoperative day, 1.27 at 2 weeks, and 1.24 at 1 year. At a mean followup of 32.8 months, long-term donor complications consisted of 11 cases of hypertension, 9 cases of prolonged pain or paresthesia, 2 incisional hernias, 1 small bowel obstruction requiring laparoscopic lysis of adhesions, and 1 hydrocele requiring repair. LDN can be performed with acceptable immediate morbidity and excellent graft function. Operative time and complications decreased significantly after a surgeon performed 150 cases. Long-term complications were uncommon but included a likely underestimated incidence of hypertension.
