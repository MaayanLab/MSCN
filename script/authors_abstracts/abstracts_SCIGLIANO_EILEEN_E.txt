Effectiveness of partner social support predicts enduring psychological distress after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) survivors who are 1 to 3 years posttransplant are challenged by the need to resume valued social roles and activities--a task that may be complicated by enduring transplant-related psychological distress common in this patient population. The present study investigated whether transplant survivors who receive adequate social support from their spouse or intimate partner experience lower distress. Effects of receiving a greater quantity of partner support (a common approach to studying enacted support) were compared with effects of receiving more effective partner support (i.e., support that more closely matches their needs in terms of its quantity and quality). Men and women (N = 230) who were 1 to 3 years posttransplant completed measures of partner support quantity (Manne & Schnoll, 2001), partner social support effectiveness (Rini & Dunkel Schetter, 2010), and psychological distress (Brief Symptom Inventory; Derogatis & Spencer, 1982). Potential medical and sociodemographic confounds were controlled in analyses. As hypothesized, survivors reported less distress when they received more effective partner support (p < .001). Quantity of partner support was not associated with distress (p = .23). An interaction revealed that when partner support was effective, the quantity of support survivors received was not associated with their distress (p = .90); however, when partner support was ineffective, receiving a greater quantity of partner support was associated with substantially elevated distress (p = .002). Findings suggest that clinical approaches to addressing or preventing enduring distress after HSCT should target features of partner support related to its appraised effectiveness.

Combining FDG-PET/CT with laboratory data yields superior results for prediction of relapse in multiple myeloma.
? The precise role of positron emission tomography (PET/CT) for predicting relapse/progression in multiple myeloma remains uncertain. We compared the predictive values of PET/CT, concurrent laboratory testing (labs), and their combination in prediction of 12-month progression, as determined by current International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. ? PET/CT and labs (serum chemistry, ?2-microglobulin, immunofixation, bone marrow biopsy, serum free light chains) were reviewed, and date of relapse/progression was determined by IMWG criteria. ? The median time from therapy to PET/CT imaging was 12.0?months (1.0-110) and median time to progression (TTP) was 29.8?months (1.6-130+). Overall survival and survival-without-progression at last follow-up were 84% and 49%, respectively. Sensitivity of PET/CT for predicting relapse/progression was lower than that of labs (0.67 vs. 0.89, ns), but PET/CT was more specific (0.89 vs. 0.79, ns). When labs and PET/CT data were combined, a positive result for either test was 89% sensitive and a positive result for both tests was 100% specific for predicting 12-month progression of disease. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significantly greater TTP for those with a negative vs. positive PET/CT (P?=?0.0005), negative vs. positive labs (P?<?0.0001), and both tests negative vs. both tests positive (P?<?0.0001). ? Combining PET/CT with laboratory data improves the accuracy of prediction of relapse/progression within 12?months compared with each test alone. Thus, integration of PET/CT into myeloma follow-up is recommended, and the impact of this approach on management should be explored.

Non-myeloablative conditioning and allogeneic transplantation for multiple myeloma.
In multiple myeloma (MM), allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT) carries a lower relapse risk than autologous transplantation but a greater transplant-related mortality. Nonmyeloablative conditioning for allogeneic transplantation (NST) reduces transplant-related toxicity. Results are encouraging when used during first remission in low-risk patients, but less-so in relapsed or refractory disease. This is a single-center retrospective analysis of 20 previously treated MM patients who underwent NST from matched-related or matched-unrelated donors from 2000-2006. Median age was 52.7 years (37.2-68.0). Twenty-five percent had advanced or high-risk disease. Eleven still had active disease prior to NST. Conditioning was total body irradiation 200 cGy on a single fraction on day -5, followed by antithymocyte globulin (ATG) 1.5 mg/kg/day and fludarabine 30 mg/m(2)/day on days -4 to -2. All received immunosuppression, most commonly with oral mycofenylate mofetil and cyclosporine beginning on day -5. At day 100, 50% had achieved complete remission. Transplant-related mortality was 25%. Median overall survival (OS) was 21.2 months (0.6-90+) and progression-free survival (PFS) 6.6 months (0.6-90+). Both OS and PFS were 24% at 3 years. OS was significantly greater for patients with age <52 years (median 27 months vs. 7.9 months, P = 0.031), and there was a trend toward greater OS for those with beta2 microglobulin <2.5 mg/l (median 27 months vs. 7.7 months, P = 0.08). Donor characteristics and Ig type had no significant effect on survival. These data suggest a benefit of NST in relapsed/refractory MM. Randomized trials must be performed to confirm and further qualify this benefit.

Combined bone marrow and peripheral blood progenitor cell autografts for patients with poor mobilization.
Peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) autografts with low CD34(+) cell content provide inadequate platelet (Plt) and red blood cell (RBC) reconstitution. Repeat collection and bone marrow (BM) harvesting are used in this situation. Minimum cell contents for BM-PBPC combined grafts are undefined. A retrospective analysis of 19 autologous stem cell transplants (ASCT) with combined BM-PBPC for poor initial PBPC collection was carried out. Mobilization was with filgrastim (10 microg/kg/day) alone for 5 days or after chemotherapy. BM was harvested if PBPC collections were CD34+<2.5 x 10(6)/kg. The median age was 55 years (range 19-74). The diagnoses were multiple myeloma (7), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (7), Hodgkin's disease (4) and acute myeloid leukemia (1). The median cell content (CD34+/kg x 10(6)) was 1.1 (0.3-2.7) for BM, 1.2 (0.04-2.8) for PBPC and 2.2 (1.4-4.9) combined. Eight grafts contained <2.0 x 10(6) CD34+/kg (1.4-1.8). The median engraftment in days (range) was: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 500, 12 (9-39); Plt > 20 000, 25 (15-70); RBC transfusion independence, 17 (6-93). Six patients died of progressive disease (58-293 days post-ASCT), one of infection on day 141 and one of AML on day 11. All patients except one maintained ANC > 1000 without filgrastim support beyond day 19. One patient had cholecystitis and delayed graft failure on day 90. PBPC CD34+ content did not predict CD34+ BM content but correlated with ANC > 500 (r= - 0.64, P=0.003). BM and combined CD34+ and BM TNC/kg did not correlate with engraftment or outcomes. Combined CD34+/kg < or > = 2.0 x 10(6) produced similar engraftment and mortality. After a failed PBPC collection, BM harvest is a reliable option for obtaining an adequate combined autograft. Combined BM-PBPC autografts with <2.0x10(6) CD34+/kg can produce satisfactory engraftment.

Graft versus host disease after stem cell allotransplantation with low-dose total body irradiation, fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin.
We previously showed that antithymocyte globulin (ATG) given with total body irradiation (TBI) 200 cGy and fludarabine results in high rate of donor engraftment. Its influence on acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) and on graft versus tumor effect is less known. Sixty-five patients underwent nonmyeloablative stem cell transplant with ATG, TBI 200 cGy, and fludarabine. GVHD prophylaxis was mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine. Forty-two patients (pts) (65%) had match related donors, 18 (27%) match unrelated, 1 (1.5%) mismatch related, and 4 (6%) mismatch unrelated donors. At a median follow-up of 862 days, 24 patients (37%) developed GVHD. The median age of the patients with and without GVHD was 56 years respectively. Acute GVHD grade II-IV developed in 19 pts (29%). Fatal GVHD of liver and/or gut occurred in nine pts (14%). Forty-one pts survived more than 100 days. Five pts (12%) had chronic GVHD, two had extensive, and three had limited involvement. Relapsed disease was observed in 22 pts (34%). Infections occurred in 15 pts (23%) and were fatal in 13 (20%). The addition of ATG to TBI 200cGy and fludarabine resulted in a modest incidence of GVHD. The best transplant outcomes were observed in pts with lymphoid malignancies.

Psychological distress in long-term survivors of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
The prevalence of psychological distress is higher in cancers with poorer prognoses and speculated as higher in those receiving more aversive treatments. Since hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is one of the most taxing cancer treatments to endure and is therefore likely to have more long-term sequelae, this study examined psychological distress symptoms in long-term HSCT survivors who were at least 1 year post-transplant. Participants in this cross-sectional study were recruited from urban medical centers as part of a larger study of HSCT survivors. The sample comprised 236 adults who were on average 3.4 years since transplant. Psychological distress was measured by a commonly used self-report questionnaire, the Brief Symptom Inventory. Clinically elevated psychological distress caseness was present in 43% of long-term HSCT survivors. Elevations were highest on clinical subscales of obsessive-compulsiveness, somatization, and psychoticism. However, item-level analyses revealed that the content of the most frequently reported symptoms included trouble with memory and feelings of loneliness. Results of this study suggest that HSCT survivors may experience memory and existential concerns and that such symptoms may not represent psychiatric sequelae.
