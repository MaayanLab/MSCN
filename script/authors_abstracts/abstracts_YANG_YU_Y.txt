c-Maf regulates IL-10 expression during Th17 polarization.
IL-10 production by Th17 cells is critical for limiting autoimmunity and inflammatory responses. Gene array analysis on Stat6 and T-bet double-deficient Th17 cells identified the Th2 transcription factor c-Maf to be synergistically up-regulated by IL-6 plus TGFbeta and associated with Th17 IL-10 production. Both c-Maf and IL-10 induction during Th17 polarization depended on Stat3, but not Stat6 or Stat1, and mechanistically differed from IL-10 regulation by Th2 or IL-27 signals. TGFbeta was also synergistic with IL-27 to induce c-Maf, and it induced Stat1-independent IL-10 expression in contrast to IL-27 alone. Retroviral transduction of c-Maf was able to induce IL-10 expression in Stat6-deficient CD4 and CD8 T cells, and c-Maf directly transactivated IL-10 gene expression through binding to a MARE (Maf recognition element) motif in the IL-10 promoter. Taken together, these data reveal a novel role for c-Maf in regulating T effector development, and they suggest that TGFbeta may antagonize Th17 immunity by IL-10 production through c-Maf induction.

T-bet and eomesodermin play critical roles in directing T cell differentiation to Th1 versus Th17.
Th1 and Th17 cells are crucial in immune regulation and autoimmune disease development. By adding Stat6 deficiency to T-bet deficiency, and thus negating effects from elevated levels of IL-4/Stat6/GATA3 Th2 signals in T-bet-deficient cells, we investigated the signals important for Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation and their role in colitis development. The data reveal that Eomesodermin compensates T-bet deficiency for IFN-gamma and Th1 development. However, without T-bet, IFN-gamma production and Th1 differentiation are susceptible to inhibition by IL-6 and TGFbeta. As a result, Th17 development is strongly favored, the threshold for TGFbeta requirement is lowered, and IL-6 drives Th17 differentiation, elucidating a critical role for T-bet in directing T cell differentiation to Th1 vs Th17. In contrast to IL-6 plus TGFbeta-driven Th17, IL-6-driven Th17 cells do not express IL-10 and they induce a more intense colitis. Naive CD4 T cells deficient in Stat6 and T-bet also induce a Th17-dominant colitis development in vivo. Our data provide new insights into the choice between Th1 and Th17 development and their roles in autoimmunity.

The sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 causes tissue retention by inhibiting the entry of peripheral tissue T lymphocytes into afferent lymphatics.
Although much is known about the migration of T cells from blood to lymph nodes, less is known about the mechanisms regulating the migration of T cells from tissues into lymph nodes through afferent lymphatics. Here we investigated T cell egress from nonlymphoid tissues into afferent lymph in vivo and developed an experimental model to recapitulate this process in vitro. Agonism of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 inhibited the entry of tissue T cells into afferent lymphatics in homeostatic and inflammatory conditions and caused the arrest, mediated at least partially by interactions of the integrin LFA-1 with its ligand ICAM-1 and of the integrin VLA-4 with its ligand VCAM-1, of polarized T cells at the basal surface of lymphatic but not blood vessel endothelium. Thus, the increased sphingosine 1-phosphate present in inflamed peripheral tissues may induce T cell retention and suppress T cell egress.

Identification of a distant T-bet enhancer responsive to IL-12/Stat4 and IFNgamma/Stat1 signals.
T-bet plays a critical role in controlling IFNgamma expression, Th1 polarization, and CD8 cytolytic development. Its regulation has been demonstrated to be mostly IFNgamma/Stat1 dependent while IL-12/Stat4 independent. Here we show that IL-12/Stat4 binds to a distant highly conserved STAT-responsive T-bet enhancer, and induces IFNgamma/Stat1-independent T-bet expression in CD8 T cells. Luciferase reporter assay showed that both Stat4 and Stat1 activate reporter gene expression from constructs containing a wild-type but not mutated T-bet enhancer. Studies in virus-infected mice demonstrated that the IL-12/Stat4/T-bet cascade operates in vivo and regulates IFNgamma in CD8 T cells. Together, we provide a novel mechanism for T-bet regulation, and suggest that IL-12/Stat4/T-bet play an important role in CD8 effector responses.
