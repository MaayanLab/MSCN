Reflex sympathetic dystrophy: reflections from a clinician.
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy is defined as chronic musculoskeletal pain and autonomic dysfunction. It is a difficult diagnosis to make, and the adolescent often sees many specialists before arriving at the correct diagnosis. In this article I review reflex sympathetic dystrophy and reflect on the differential diagnosis, pertinent medical history, personal characteristics of patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation. Principles of management are considered, including physical therapy, pharmacology, psychological therapy, and alternative therapies. Accurate diagnosis and management are critical for not prolonging the adolescent's and the family's suffering. It is important to provide aggressive physical therapy, stress management, relaxation training, and close follow-up. It is also critical to avoid immobilization, surgery, or invasive procedures and unnecessary tests.
