Recurrent intrahepatic pigmented stones after liver transplantation in a patient with hemoglobin SC disease: Case report and review of the literature.
Tomaino J, Keegan T, Kerkar N, Facciuto M, Miloh T, Taouli B, Hurlet A, Weintraub J, Sejpal D, Arnon R. Recurrent intrahepatic pigmented stones after liver transplantation in a patient with hemoglobin SC disease: Case report and review of the literature. Pediatr Transplantation 2011. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? Patients with hemoglobinopathies may have hepatic involvement, which if severe, can lead to chronic liver disease and a need for liver transplant. Here, we present a case of a 16-yr-old female adolescent who presented to our center with hemoglobin SC disease, obstructive jaundice because of pigmented intrahepatic biliary stones, and progressive liver disease. She underwent a successful liver transplant but a few years later, she developed recurrent cholangitis and graft dysfunction because of recurrent intrahepatic biliary stones. Recurrent formation of intrahepatic stones after liver transplant is a rare and severe complication in patients with hemoglobinopathies. We recommend hypertransfusion therapy and surveillance imaging studies after liver transplant for early detection and prevention of this complication.

Arnon R, Annunziato R, Miloh T, Wasserstein M, Sogawa H, Wilson M, Suchy F, Kerkar N. Liver transplantation for hereditary tyrosinemia type I: Analysis of the UNOS database. Pediatr Transplantation 2011: 15: 400-405. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? Patients with HT-1 can develop progressive liver disease and have a high incidence of HCC. LT is indicated in patients with fulminant liver failure, HCC or decompensated chronic liver disease refractory to NTBC. To determine the need for LT and outcomes after LT in children with HT-1. Children with HT-1 who had LT between 10/1987 and 5/2008 were identified from the UNOS database. Of 11?467 children in the UNOS database, 125 (1.1%) required LT secondary to HT-1. Mean age at LT was two and half yr (s.d.?±?3.6?yr). Mean age at LT during the first 10?yr of the study (1.82, s.d.?±?2.86?yr) was significantly lower than in the last decade (3.70, s.d.?±?4.42?yr), p?=?0.01. Nearly half of the patients (58, 46.4%) were transplanted between 1988 and 1992. Overall, one- and five-yr patient survival was 90.4% and 90.4%, respectively. LT is a valuable option for children with HT-1 with fulminant liver failure or when medical treatment fails. The rate of LT for children with HT-1 has decreased and age at transplant increased over the last decade most probably reflecting the effect of early diagnosis and treatment with NTBC.

Arnon R, Annunziato RA, Miloh T, Padilla M, Sogawa H, Batemarco L, Willis A, Suchy F, Kerkar N. Liver and combined lung and liver transplantation for cystic fibrosis: Analysis of the UNOS database. Pediatr Transplantation 2011: 15: 254-264. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? A proportion of patients with CF develop cirrhosis and portal hypertension. LT and combined LLT are rarely performed in patients with CF. To determine the outcome of LT and LLT in patients with CF. Patients with CF who had LT or LLT between 10/1987 and 5/2008 were identified from UNOS database. A total of 182 children (<18?yr) and 48 adults underwent isolated LT for CF. Seven more children and eight adults with CF underwent combined LLT. One- and five-yr patient and graft survival were not significantly different in patients who underwent LT in comparison with patients who underwent LLT (patient survival: LT; 83.9%, 75.7%, LLT; 80%, 80%; graft survival: LT; 76.1%, 67.0%, LLT; 80.0%, 80.0%, respectively). The two major causes of death after LT were pulmonary disease (15 patients, 22.7%) and hemorrhage (12 patients, 18.2%). Bilirubin was identified as a risk factor for death, and previous liver transplant and prolonged cold ischemic time were identified as risk factors for graft loss in LT patients. LT is a viable option for children and young adults with CF and end-stage liver disease. Outcome of LLT patients with CF was comparable to the outcome of patients with CF who underwent isolated LT.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome in children - is conventional liver transplantation always needed?
Willis AD, Miloh TA, Arnon R, Iyer KR, Suchy FJ, Kerkar N. Hepatopulmonary syndrome in children - is conventional liver transplantation always needed? Clin Transplant 2010 DOI: 10.1111/j.1399-0012.2010.01378.x. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? Background:? Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is the association of liver disease, hypoxemia, and intrapulmonary vascular dilatations. There are little data on the management of HPS in children other than conventional orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Aims:? To describe the patient characteristics, mode of diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of children with HPS at our center. Methods:? Retrospective review of patients diagnosed with HPS between 1997 and 2007 after IRB approval. Results:? There were 10 patients, six females; median age at diagnosis of HPS was 12?yr. Six with cirrhosis underwent OLT and had subsequent resolution of HPS and are stable at last follow-up. Of the remaining four, two had cirrhosis. HPS resolved without conventional OLT in the following four patients: hepatitis C after antiviral treatment, biliary atresia with portal hypertension after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting, Abernethy syndrome after auxiliary partial OLT, and in a child with splenic vein thrombosis after splenectomy. Conclusions:? Our series shows resolution of HPS in all patients and 100% survival after conventional OLT. Four children had resolution of HPS after surgical or medical treatments other than conventional OLT. Careful review of clinical status and underlying pathophysiology and anatomy at diagnosis of HPS should inform treatment decisions.

Liver transplantation for children with Wilson disease: comparison of outcomes between children and adults.
Liver transplantation (LT) is lifesaving for patients with Wilson disease (WD) presenting with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) or chronic liver disease (CLD) unresponsive to treatment. To determine the outcome of LT in pediatric and adult patients with WD. United Network for Organ Sharing data on LT from 1987 to 2008 were analyzed. Outcomes were compared for patients requiring LT for FHF and CLD after 2002. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for death and graft loss. Of 90,867 patients transplanted between 1987 and 2008, 170 children and 400 adults had WD. The one- and five-yr patient survival of children was 90.1% and 89% compared to 88.3% and 86% for adults, p = 0.53, 0.34. After 2002, 103 (41 children) were transplanted for FHF and 67 (10 children) for CLD. One- and five-yr patient survival was higher in children transplanted for CLD compared to FHF; 100%, 100% vs. 90%, 87.5% respectively, p = 0.30, 0.32. One- and five-yr patient survival was higher in adults transplanted for CLD compared to FHF; 94.7%, 90.1% vs. 90.3%, 89.7%, respectively, p = 0.36, 0.88. Encephalopathy, partial graft, and ventilator use were risk factors for death by logistic regression. LT is an excellent treatment option for patients with WD. Patients transplanted for CLD had higher patient survival rates than patients with FHF.

Roux-en-Y loop varices in children with portal hypertension after liver transplantation: An unusual cause of "obscure" gastrointestinal bleeding.
Chu J, Kerkar N, Miloh TA, Rodriguez-Laiz G, Lewis B, Stangl A, Newton KP, Iyer K, Arnon R. Roux-en-Y loop varices in children with portal hypertension after liver transplantation: An unusual cause of "obscure" gastro intestinal bleeding. Pediatr Transplantation 2010: (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract: PHALT may result from graft dysfunction, portal vein thrombosis, arterio-venous fistulas and can lead to GIB, commonly from bleeding esophageal varices. We present three children with GIB requiring multiple blood transfusions that were diagnosed with RY Loop bleeding. Routine EGD, colonoscopy, and CE failed to reveal the bleeding source. However, enteroscopy revealed large varices at the site of hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis in all. Our experience demonstrates that RY loop varices in children with PHALT are a rare and treatable cause of obscure GI bleeding.

Liver transplantation in children with metabolic diseases: the studies of pediatric liver transplantation experience.
Metabolic diseases are the second largest indication for LT in children after BA. There are limited data on the long-term post-transplant outcome in this unique group of patients. Therefore, our aim was to assess post-liver transplant outcomes and to evaluate risk factors for mortality and graft loss in children with metabolic disorders in comparison to those with non-metabolic diagnoses. We reviewed all patients enrolled in the SPLIT registry. Between 1995 and 2008, 446 of 2997 (14.9%) children enrolled in SPLIT underwent liver transplant for metabolic diseases. One-yr and five-yr patient survival for children with metabolic diseases was 94.6% and 88.9% and for those with other diseases 90.7% and 86.1% (log-rank p = 0.05), respectively. One-yr and five-yr graft survival for children with metabolic disorders was 90.8% and 83.8%, and for those with other diseases 85.4% and 78.0% (log-rank p = 0.005), respectively. Children with metabolic diseases were less likely to experience gastrointestinal complications (5.6% vs. 10.7%, p = 0.001), portal vein thrombosis (2.9% vs. 5.2%, p = 0.04), and reoperations within 30 days post-transplant (33.4% vs. 37.8%, p = 0.05) than those with other indications. In conclusion, children who underwent liver transplant for metabolic disease had similarly excellent patient survival as, and better graft survival than, those who received a liver allograft for other indications.

Orthotopic liver transplantation for children with Alagille syndrome.
AGS is an inherited disorder involving the liver, heart, eyes, face, and skeleton. Aim: To determine the outcome of LT in children with AGS compared to those with BA. Methods: Children with AGS and BA who had a LT between 10/1987 and 5/2008 were identified from the UNOS database. Results: Of 11 467 children who received a liver transplant, 461 (4.0%) had AGS and 3056 (26.7%) had BA. One- and five-yr patient survival was significantly lower in patients with AGS in comparison with patients with BA (AGS; 82.9%, 78.4%, BA; 89.9%, 84%, respectively). Early death (<30 days from transplant) was significantly higher in AGS than in BA. One- and five-yr graft survival was significantly lower in AGS than in BA (AGS; 74.7%, 61.5%, BA; 81.6%, 70.0%, respectively). Death from graft failure, neurological, and cardiac complications was significantly higher in patients with AGS than in patients with BA. Serum creatinine at transplant, prior LT, and cold ischemic time >12 h were identified as risk factors for death. Conclusion: Children with AGS were older at the time of LT and their one- and five-yr patient and graft survival were significantly lower compared to BA. Risk factors for poor outcome in AGS after LT were identified.

Resolution of hepatopulmonary syndrome after auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation in Abernethy malformation. A case report.
Congenital absence of portal vein and extrahepatic portocaval shunt, also referred to as an Abernethy type 1, is a rare malformation of the mesenteric vasculature. A 9-year-old girl presented with dyspnea on exertion and orthodeoxia. A diagnosis of an Abernethy malformation type 1b and hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) was made, and she underwent auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation (APOLT). Symptoms and signs of HPS resolved 2 months after the operation. HPS in Abernethy syndrome is a manifestation of normal portal blood flow bypassing the liver and can be ameliorated by redirecting blood flow to a segment of liver with normal portal anatomy. APOLT is a feasible and successful surgical procedure for patients with Abernethy malformation and HPS.

Wilson disease in children: serum aminotransferases and urinary copper on triethylene tetramine dihydrochloride (trientine) treatment.
To evaluate the efficacy of and adherence to trientine and/or zinc therapy in children with Wilson disease (WD). We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of all children with WD in the pediatric liver/liver transplant program at our institution between 1998 and 2006. A total of 22 children with WD were evaluated and treated. Seven with fulminant disease required liver transplantation and 15 were treated with trientine and/or zinc. Ten of those 15 had follow-up for 12 to 60 months and 6 of the latter 10 were followed for 12 to 18 months. All 10 patients were started on a trientine treatment regimen. Mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels decreased from 183 +/- 103 IU at presentation (n = 10) to 80 +/- 46 IU at 12 months (n = 10) and 66 +/- 40 IU at 18 months (n = 7). Mean 24-hour urinary copper levels increased from 156 microg at presentation to 494 microg at 1 to 2 months, then decreased to 71 microg after 21 to 24 months of treatment. Three of 10 patients had normalized ALT levels and 1 patient with cirrhosis continued with normal ALT levels since presentation. Four of 10 patients were documented to be nonadherent, as manifested by increased ALT levels (99 +/- 31 IU); 1 patient had previously normalized ALT levels. In 3 of 10 patients, ALT level decreased but remained at an abnormal level (93 +/- 53 IU). Trientine and/or zinc therapy is effective for children with WD. Nonadherence is a common cause of increased aminotransferase levels in patients with WD.
