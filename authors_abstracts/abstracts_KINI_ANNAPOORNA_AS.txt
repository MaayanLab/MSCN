A novel clinical prediction rule for 30-day mortality following balloon aortic valuloplasty: The CRRAC the AV score.
Objectives: We seek to identify predictors of 30-day mortality after balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV). Background: To date, there is no validated method of predicting patient outcomes after percutaneous aortic valve interventions. Methods: Data for consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent BAV at the Mount Sinai Medical Center from January 2001 to July 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. Cox-proportional hazards regression was used to identify significant predictors of 30-day mortality, and the resultant model was compared to the EuroSCORE using Akaike's Information Criterion and area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC). Results: The analysis included 281 patients (age 83 ± 9 years, 61% women, aortic valve area: 0.64 ± 0.2 cm(2) ) and 36 (12.8%) of whom died within 30 days of BAV. With identified risk factors for 30-day mortality, critical status, renal dysfunction, right atrial pressure, and cardiac output, we constructed the CRRAC the AV risk score. Thirty-day survival was 72% in the highest tertile versus 94% in the lower two tertiles of the score. Compared to the additive and logistic EuroSCORE, the risk score demonstrated superior discrimination (AUC = 0.75 vs. 0.60 and 0.63, respectively). Conclusions: We derived a risk score, the CRRAC the AV score that identifies patients at high-risk of 30-day mortality after BAV. Validation of the developed risk prediction score, the CRRAC the AV score, is needed in other cohorts of post-BAV patients and potentially in patients undergoing other catheter-based valve interventions. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Bolus-only versus bolus + infusion of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors during percutaneous coronary intervention.
The present study was done to analyze if glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI) bolus-only will reduce vascular/bleeding complications and cost with similar major adverse cardiac events (MACE) when compared with GPI bolus + infusion. Evidence-based therapy of GPI inhibitors during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) incorporates intravenous bolus followed by 12 to 18 hours of infusion. However, GPI bolus + infusion may increase vascular/bleeding complications and may not reduce MACE when compared with GPI bolus-only. From January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2004, 2,629 consecutive patients received GPI during PCI at a single center. Of these, 1,064 patients received GPI bolus + infusion in 2003 and were compared with 1,565 patients that received GPI bolus-only in 2004. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. Patients receiving GPI bolus-only had reduced vascular/bleeding complications when compared with bolus + infusion (4.9% vs 7%, P < .05, odds ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.45-0.89). Furthermore, ischemic complications were similar in both groups, including periprocedural creatine kinase-MB enzyme release (12.8% vs 15.3%, P = NS), MACE at 30 days (3.2% vs 3%, P = NS), and death and myocardial infarction at 1 year (7.1% vs 7.8%, P = NS). In addition, GPI bolus-only reduced cost in US dollars ($323 vs $706, P < .001) and increased ambulatory PCI (13.1% vs 3.2%, P < .01), with reduced length of stay (1.1 vs 1.6 days, P < .01), when compared with GPI bolus + infusion. Glycoprotein inhibitor bolus-only reduces vascular/bleeding complications with similar MACE and reduced cost when compared with GPI bolus + infusion. In addition, GPI bolus-only improved ambulatory PCI and reduced length of stay. These results are consistent with a safer and cost-effective strategy for bolus-only when GPI therapy is considered during PCI.

Results and predictors of early and late outcome of coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with severely depressed left ventricular function.
Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a well-accepted therapeutic approach in patients with symptomatic multivessel coronary artery disease and severely depressed left ventricular function. However, the potential impact of off-pump CABG in this group of patients remains unknown. In addition, there are only scarce data regarding long-term survival and its predictors in this patient population. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data of 2,725 consecutive patients (mean age, 65 +/- 11 years; 843 (31%) female) undergoing CABG between January 1998 and December 2005 (ejection fraction [EF] < or = 0.30; n = 495, 18%). Outcome measures included hospital mortality, major complications, and long-term survival. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of hospital mortality and late survival. Subgroup analysis for patients with EF less than or equal to 0.30 undergoing conventional CABG (n = 424, 86%) versus off-pump CABG (n = 71, 14%) was performed. Hospital mortality was 1.8% (EF < or = 0.30, 3.6%; EF > 0.30, 1.4%; p = 0.002). Off-pump CABG did not have an impact on operative mortality (on-pump, 4%; off-pump, 3%; p = 0.509). Ejection fraction of 0.30 or less was not an independent risk factor of hospital mortality but predicted respiratory failure (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3) and sepsis (OR, 1.4). Long-term survival was significantly decreased in patients with EF of 0.30 or less: 1-year and 5-year survival 88% +/- 1.5% and 75% +/- 2.2% versus 96% +/- 0.4% and 81% +/- 1.2%, respectively (p = 0.001). Reoperation (OR, 6.9), peripheral vascular disease (OR, 3.2), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 3.0), congestive heart failure (OR, 2.7), and female sex (OR, 2.1) were independent predictors of long-term survival. Excellent results after CABG can be expected in patients with EF of 0.30 or less, with minimal increase in mortality and acceptable postoperative morbidity. Long-term survival remains limited, but recent results are substantially better than historical reports. Careful preoperative patient selection and perioperative management are essential in these patients undergoing CABG.

Comparison of platelet function and morphology in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention receiving bivalirudin versus unfractionated heparin versus clopidogrel pretreatment and bivalirudin.
We hypothesized that direct thrombin inhibition could attenuate platelet activation and release of soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), a marker of inflammation, during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). To assess platelet function under flow conditions with bivalirudin versus unfractionated heparin (UFH), we employed the cone and plate(let) analyzer (CPA) assay in drug-spiked blood samples from volunteers (n = 3) in vitro, and then in PCI patients who received bivalirudin alone (n = 20), UFH alone (n = 15), and clopidogrel pretreatment plus bivalirudin (n = 15). Scanning electron microscopy was employed to image bivalirudin or UFH-treated platelets to determine whether platelet function observations had a morphologic explanation. Enzyme immunoassay was used to measure sCD40L levels in PCI patients. In vitro, bivalirudin decreased platelet surface coverage; UFH increased platelet surface coverage. In PCI patients, bivalirudin alone decreased platelet surface coverage, UFH alone increased platelet surface coverage, and clopidogrel pretreatment plus bivalirudin additively reduced platelet surface coverage. Unlike UFH, bivalirudin did not activate platelets in SEM studies. Bivalirudin alone or coupled with clopidogrel significantly reduced plasma sCD40L in PCI patients. In conclusion, our findings suggest that under flow conditions, bivalirudin alone or coupled with clopidogrel may have an antiplatelet effect versus UFH alone during PCI. These data suggest that bivalirudin and UFH may confer an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing sCD40L during PCI.

Coronary bifurcation lesions.
Coronary bifurcations are prone to develop atherosclerotic plaque due to turbulent blood flow and high shear stress. These lesions amount to 15-20% of the total number of interventions. The true bifurcation lesion consist of >50% diameter obstruction of the main vessel (MV) and of the side branch (SB) in an inverted "Y" fashion. Treatment of coronary bifurcation lesions represents a challenging area in interventional cardiology but recent advances in percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) have led to the dramatic increase in the number of patients successfully treated percutaneously. When compared with non-bifurcation interventions, bifurcation interventions have a lower rate of procedural success, higher procedural costs, longer hospitalization and a higher clinical and angiographic restenosis. Introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) has resulted in a lower event rate and reduction of main vessel (MV) restenosis in comparison with historical controls. However, side branch (SB) ostial residual stenosis and long-term restenosis remains a problem. Although stenting the MV with provisional SB stenting seems to be the prevailing approach, in the era of DES various two-stent techniques have emerged to allow stenting of the large side branch.
