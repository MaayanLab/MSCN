Effect of SPP 301, an endothelin antagonist, on intraocular pressure in glaucomatous monkey eyes.
To evaluate the effect of topical application of avosentan (SPP 301), endothelin receptor type A antagonist, on intraocular pressure (IOP) in monkey eyes with laser-induced unilateral glaucoma. A multiple-dose study was performed in eight glaucomatous monkey eyes that were topically treated with SPP 301 by applying a 50 µl drop (25 µl?×?2) at 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. for 5 consecutive days at three concentrations (0.003%, 0.03%, or 0.3%). IOP was measured hourly for 6 hrs on each day of the study beginning at 9:30 a.m. for one baseline day, one vehicle-treated day, and treatment days 1, 3, and 5. Twice daily administration of each of the three concentrations of SPP 301 for 5 days significantly (p?<?0.05) reduced IOP. The maximum reduction in IOP occurred 2 or 3 hrs after morning dosing and was 1.8 ± 0.8 (mean ± SEM) mmHg (6%) for 0.003% SPP 301, 4.1 ± 0.7 mmHg (13%) for 0.03% SPP 301, and 7.1 ± 1.3 mmHg (21%) for 0.3% SPP 301. The longest duration of IOP reduction was for 2 hrs with 0.003% SPP 301, and was for at least 6 hrs with 0.03% and 0.3% concentrations. Compared to 0.03% or 0.003% concentrations, 0.3% SPP 301 produced a greater (p?<?0.05) IOP reduction. IOP was reduced in fellow untreated normal eyes 2?hr after morning dosing with 0.3% SPP 301, maximum reduction in IOP (11%) occurred on day 1. Of the eyes treated with 0.3% SPP 301, one eye demonstrated mild conjunctival discharge and one eye was closed for 5 min after dosing. Topically applied SPP 301, an endothelin antagonist, reduced IOP in glaucomatous monkey eyes in a dose-dependent manner. Endothelin antagonists, a novel class of compound, may have potential for the treatment of glaucoma.

The effect of selective laser trabeculoplasty on intraocular pressure in patients with intravitreal steroid-induced elevated intraocular pressure.
To assess effectiveness of selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with steroid-induced elevated IOP. Retrospective review of 7 patients (7 eyes) with IOP elevation after intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (4.0 mg/0.1 mL) injections for macular edema (6 patients) or central retinal vein occlusion (1 patient). Three patients had preexisting open angle glaucoma; 2 patients had preexisting ocular hypertension. Time between intraocular corticosteroid injection and subsequent increased IOP ranged from 5 to 29 weeks. After unsuccessful maximum tolerated medical therapy, patients underwent unilateral SLT between April 2003 and June 2005. IOP was measured 4 weeks prelaser; on the day of laser; within 3 weeks, and at 1, 3, and 6 months postlaser. Two-sample t test was used for analysis. The pre-SLT and post-SLT IOP measurements were the major outcome measures used to define the relative success of the SLT procedure. Seven patients were taking 4.0+/-0.8 ocular hypotensive medications before SLT. Preoperative IOP (mm Hg+/-SD) 38.4+/-7.3 decreased postoperative to 25.6+/-7.1 within 3 weeks (P<0.003), 25.9+/-8.8 at 1 month (P<0.007), 23.9+/-10.6 at 3 months (P<0.006), and 15.7+/-2.2 at 6 months (P<0.001). Four patients underwent a second SLT procedure. Two patients failed after the 3-month visit. IOP in fellow eyes of all patients was unchanged (P>0.080). SLT lowered (P<0.007) IOP in 5 eyes of 7 patients with steroid-induced increased IOP from 3 weeks to 6 months postoperative. Two patients required additional surgical procedures. Repeat SLT treatments may be necessary. SLT is a temporizing procedure to consider in patients with steroid-induced elevated IOP.
