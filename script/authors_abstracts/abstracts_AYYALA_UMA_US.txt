Cardiac sarcoidosis.
Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease with a favorable prognosis, high remission rate, and low mortality. Cardiac involvement alters this prognosis. Clinical manifestations most commonly include arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and congestive heart failure. Treatment includes immunosuppressant therapy, permanent pacemakers in the setting of conduction abnormalities, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in patients at risk for sudden cardiac death. Risk stratification for sudden cardiac death is essential in otherwise asymptomatic patients who have suspected cardiac sarcoidosis.
