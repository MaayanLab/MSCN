Kidney early evaluation program: a community-based screening approach to address disparities in chronic kidney disease.
The Kidney Early Evaluation Program (KEEP) is a free, community-based, kidney disease screening program designed to detect chronic kidney disease (CKD) early and promote follow-up evaluation with clinicians to ultimately improve outcomes. This program screens individuals with diabetes, hypertension, or those with a first-degree relative with diabetes, hypertension, and/or kidney disease. Data based on 89,552 KEEP participants screened in 49 states from early August 2000 until end of December 2007 disclosed a prevalence of 34% African Americans, 12.4% Hispanics, 5.6% Asian/Pacific Islanders, and 4.5% Native Americans. Compared with the random US population sample in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 to 2006 and the US Census Bureau 2000, KEEP represented 3-fold more African Americans and Native Americans and a similar proportion of Hispanics and Asians/Pacific Islanders. Analysis of KEEP data confirm that control of CKD risk factors and awareness of CKD remains low. In conclusion, KEEP is an enriched source of populations at high risk for CKD, and control of the two major CKD risk factors, diabetes and hypertension, remains disappointingly low, especially in high-risk populations, despite disease awareness. A longitudinal component of KEEP will evaluate the impact of the program on health disparities over time and holds promise for improving awareness and possibly future management of CKD risk factors.

Screening populations at increased risk of CKD: the Kidney Early Evaluation Program (KEEP) and the public health problem.
The epidemiological characteristics of the US end-stage renal disease population growth and increased costs in the late 1980s framed the public health agenda for the development of a community-based chronic kidney disease (CKD) screening program. Development of the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Early Evaluation Program (KEEP) included 2 preliminary screening programs, the Computerized Assessment of Risk and Education and the KEEP pilot, which was organized around the African American Study of Kidney Diseases clinical centers. The current KEEP program, launched in August 2000, targets individuals with diabetes, hypertension, or a family history of diabetes or hypertension or CKD. The screening includes informed consent, health screening questionnaire, diagnostic panel, and physician consultation. Participants are followed up by telephone and mail. Of 100,000 KEEP participants screened, 28.7% have CKD and 6.7% self-reported CKD stages 1 to 5. Conversely, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 results show 13.1% CKD prevalence; 2.9% of women and 17.9% of men with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) self-report CKD. CKD prevalences in KEEP by stage are 3.1% for stage 1; 4.8%, stage 2; 19.7%, stage 3; and 1.1%, stages 4 and 5, confirming the ability of this targeted screening program to detect CKD early. In addition to identifying individuals at increased risk of kidney disease, KEEP's structured data collection provides an opportunity to advance knowledge about kidney disease and advance the CKD public health agenda.

Trends in mineral metabolism: Kidney Early Evaluation Program (KEEP) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2004.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with mineral metabolism dysregulation, cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality. No study specifically examined mineral metabolism trends in a generalizable sample of patients at increased CKD risk. This cross-sectional analysis from November 1, 2005, to December 31, 2006, of calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) includes 2,646 individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Early Evaluation Program (KEEP), a community-based health-screening program targeting individuals 18 years and older with diabetes, hypertension, or family history of kidney disease, diabetes, or hypertension. A parallel analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2004 data was performed. In KEEP, as eGFR decreased from 55 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), calcium level decreased (9.55 +/- 0.47 to 9.34 +/- 0.62 mg/dL; P < 0.001), phosphorus level increased (3.70 +/- 0.59 to 4.15 +/- 0.80 mg/dL; P < 0.001), and PTH level increased (66.3 +/- 36.3 to 164 +/- 109 pg/mL; mean, 80.8 +/- 57.0 pg/mL; P < 0.001). NHANES 1999-2004 showed similar trends, with PTH values not as high. Individuals within opinion-based Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiatives targets from the highest to the lowest eGFR group were as follows: calcium, 93.0% to 92.3% (KEEP) and 97.4% to 89.6% (NHANES); phosphorus, 90.4% to 90.3% (KEEP) and 91.6% to 87.1% (NHANES); and PTH, 46.1% to 31.2% (KEEP) and 56.4% to 36.1% (NHANES). In a community-based CKD screening population, increased PTH level occurs early in patients with stage 3, typically with normal calcium and phosphorus levels. These findings support the importance of including PTH with calcium and phosphorus monitoring for individuals with eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2).
