Differential diagnosis of dementia.
Alzheimer's disease is by far the most common degenerative dementia, followed by dementia caused by cerebrovascular disease, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. These dementia subtypes have more overlapping signs and symptoms than defining ones. However, accurate diagnosis is important as each subtype has unique prognostic and treatment considerations. Key elements of the history, physical exam and diagnostic tests useful in deferential diagnosis of dementia sub-types are reviewed here.
