Major Complications in Revision Adult Deformity Surgery: Risk Factors and Clinical Outcomes with Two- to Seven-Year Follow-Up.
ABSTRACT: Study Design: Retrospective cohort comparative studyObjective: To determine the prevalence of major complications, identify risk factors and assess long-term clinical benefit following revision adult spinal deformity surgery.Summary of Background Data: No study has analyzed risk factors for major complications in long revision fusion surgery and whether or not occurrence of a major complication affects ultimate clinical outcome.Methods: Analysis of consecutive adult patients who underwent multilevel revision surgery for spinal deformity with a minimum 2-year follow-up was performed. All complications were classified as either major or minor. Outcome analysis was conducted with the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores.Results: 166 patients (mean age 53.8 years) were identified with a mean follow-up of 3.5 years (range 2-7). Primary diagnoses included idiopathic/de novo scoliosis (107), degenerative (35), trauma (7), neuromuscular scoliosis (6), congenital deformity (5), ankylosing spondylitis (2), tumor (2), Scheuermann's kyphosis (1) and rheumatoid arthritis (1). Most common secondary diagnoses that necessitated revision surgery were adjacent segment disease, fixed sagittal imbalance and pseudarthrosis. Overall, 34.3% of patients developed major complications (19.3% perioperative; 18.7% follow-up). Associated risk factors for perioperative complications were patient- (age >60 years, medical comorbidities, obesity) and surgery-related (pedicle subtraction osteotomy). Performance of a three-column osteotomy and postoperative radiographic changes that suggested progressive loss of sagittal correction were recognized as risk factors for follow-up complications. Equivalent outcome scores were reported by patients preoperatively, but those experiencing follow-up complications reported lower scores at the final follow-up.Conclusion: 34.4% of patients experienced major complications following long revision fusion surgery. Different risk factors were identified for perioperative vs. follow-up complications. The occurrence of a follow-up, not but perioperative, major complication seemed to have a negative impact on ultimate clinical outcome.

Comparative Analysis of Clinical Outcome and Complications in Primary vs. Revision Adult Scoliosis Surgery.
ABSTRACT: Study Design: A retrospective case comparison studyObjective: We compared clinical outcome and complications in adult patients who underwent primary (P) vs. revision (R) scoliosis surgery.Summary of Background Data: There is a paucity of data comparing P vs. R adult scoliosis patients with respect to their complication rates and clinical outcome.Methods: Assessment of 250 consecutive adult patients who underwent P vs. R surgery for idiopathic or de novo scoliosis between 2002 and 2007 with a minimum 2-year follow-up was performed.Results: There were 126 patients in P group and 124 in R group. Mean age at surgery (P = 51.2 vs. R = 51.6 years, p = 0.79), length of follow-up (P = 3.6 vs. R = 3.6 years, p = 0.94), comorbidities (p = 0.43), and smoking status (p = 0.98) were similar between the 2 groups. Body mass index (P = 25.5 vs. R = 27.4 kg/m, p = 0.01), number of final instrumented levels (P = 10.5 vs. R 12.1 levels, p = 0.00), fusion to the sacrum (P = 61.0% vs. R = 87.1%, p = 0.00), osteotomy (P = 14.3% vs. R = 54.9%, p = 0.00), length of surgery (P = 6.5 vs. R = 8.2 hrs, p = 0.00), and estimated blood loss (P = 1072.1 vs. R = 1401.3 ml, p = 0.05) were different. Primary patients had significantly lower overall complications than revision patients (P = 45.2% vs. R = 58.2%, p = 0.042). Primary patients reported significantly higher preoperative and final clinical outcome measures in function, pain, and subscore SRS domains and ODI compared to revision patients (all p<0.05). Patients over 60 years of age, however, reported similar SRS and ODI scores between the 2 groups. The extent of surgical benefit patients received, i.e., final minus preoperative score, was similar in all categories between the 2 groups.Conclusion: Adult patients undergoing primary scoliosis surgery had significantly lower overall complications compared to revision patients. Primary patients reported higher preoperative and final clinical outcome measures than revision patients, although this difference disappeared in older patients. The benefit of surgery was similar between the 2 groups.
