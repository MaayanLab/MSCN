Liver and combined lung and liver transplantation for cystic fibrosis: Analysis of the UNOS database.
Arnon R, Annunziato RA, Miloh T, Padilla M, Sogawa H, Batemarco L, Willis A, Suchy F, Kerkar N. Liver and combined lung and liver transplantation for cystic fibrosis: Analysis of the UNOS database. Pediatr Transplantation 2011: 15: 254-264. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? A proportion of patients with CF develop cirrhosis and portal hypertension. LT and combined LLT are rarely performed in patients with CF. To determine the outcome of LT and LLT in patients with CF. Patients with CF who had LT or LLT between 10/1987 and 5/2008 were identified from UNOS database. A total of 182 children (<18?yr) and 48 adults underwent isolated LT for CF. Seven more children and eight adults with CF underwent combined LLT. One- and five-yr patient and graft survival were not significantly different in patients who underwent LT in comparison with patients who underwent LLT (patient survival: LT; 83.9%, 75.7%, LLT; 80%, 80%; graft survival: LT; 76.1%, 67.0%, LLT; 80.0%, 80.0%, respectively). The two major causes of death after LT were pulmonary disease (15 patients, 22.7%) and hemorrhage (12 patients, 18.2%). Bilirubin was identified as a risk factor for death, and previous liver transplant and prolonged cold ischemic time were identified as risk factors for graft loss in LT patients. LT is a viable option for children and young adults with CF and end-stage liver disease. Outcome of LLT patients with CF was comparable to the outcome of patients with CF who underwent isolated LT.

Liver transplantation for children with Wilson disease: comparison of outcomes between children and adults.
Liver transplantation (LT) is lifesaving for patients with Wilson disease (WD) presenting with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) or chronic liver disease (CLD) unresponsive to treatment. To determine the outcome of LT in pediatric and adult patients with WD. United Network for Organ Sharing data on LT from 1987 to 2008 were analyzed. Outcomes were compared for patients requiring LT for FHF and CLD after 2002. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for death and graft loss. Of 90,867 patients transplanted between 1987 and 2008, 170 children and 400 adults had WD. The one- and five-yr patient survival of children was 90.1% and 89% compared to 88.3% and 86% for adults, p = 0.53, 0.34. After 2002, 103 (41 children) were transplanted for FHF and 67 (10 children) for CLD. One- and five-yr patient survival was higher in children transplanted for CLD compared to FHF; 100%, 100% vs. 90%, 87.5% respectively, p = 0.30, 0.32. One- and five-yr patient survival was higher in adults transplanted for CLD compared to FHF; 94.7%, 90.1% vs. 90.3%, 89.7%, respectively, p = 0.36, 0.88. Encephalopathy, partial graft, and ventilator use were risk factors for death by logistic regression. LT is an excellent treatment option for patients with WD. Patients transplanted for CLD had higher patient survival rates than patients with FHF.

Farber's disease type IV presenting with cholestasis and neonatal liver failure: report of two cases.
We report 2 siblings diagnosed with Farber's disease type IV. Type IV is a subtype of Farber's disease that presents in the neonatal period and usually initially lacks the triad of symptoms, including painful and deformed joints, subcutaneous nodules, and hoarse cry, classically seen in the other subtypes. While it is well known that all neonates with type IV present with hepatomegaly, a previously unrecognized presentation is that of cholestatic jaundice and rapidly evolving liver failure. We describe 2 siblings who presented with jaundice in the neonatal period and discuss the clinical data and variation in pathologic findings that should be considered for the diagnosis.
