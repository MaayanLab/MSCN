The detection of premalignant colon polyps during colonoscopy is stable throughout the workday.
BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that colonoscopic polyp detection decreases as the workday progresses. This may reflect time-dependent factors such as colonoscopist fatigue and decreased colon cleanliness, which can be addressed through adaptations in colonoscopy practice. OBJECTIVE: To test for time-of-day differences in adenomatous polyp (AP) and sessile serrated polyp (SSP) detection in a practice that uses split-dose bowel preparation and moderated daily colonoscopist procedure loads. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Community-based, group gastroenterology practice. PATIENTS: This study involved 2439 patients undergoing surveillance or screening colonoscopy. INTERVENTION: Colonoscopy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Detection rate of all premalignant polyps (PMPs), and of APs and SSPs, individually. RESULTS: A total of 1183 PMPs were identified in 1486 eligible patients (mean PMP/colonoscopy = 0.80; PMP detection rate = 47%). In univariate and multivariate analyses, PMP detection as well as detection of APs or SSPs individually did not vary significantly in relation to the hour of the day. In a binary comparison of morning (am) versus afternoon (pm) procedures, the total polyp detection rate was 67% and 66%, respectively. For PMPs, APs, SSPs, and hyperplastic polyps (HPs), the am and pm detection rates were 46% and 47%, 41% and 44%, 8% and 8%, and 27% and 24%, respectively. Bowel preparation quality was independent of time of day and was rated excellent or good in 86% to 87% of cases. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective, nonrandomized study. CONCLUSION: Stable PMP, AP, SSP, and HP detection rates throughout the workday occur under certain practice conditions, including the use of split-dose bowel preparation and/or moderated daily colonoscopist procedure loads.

Is gastroduodenal biopsy safe in patients receiving aspirin and clopidogrel?: a prospective, randomized study involving 630 biopsies.
To assess prospectively the bleeding risk attributable to gastroduodenal biopsy in subjects taking antiplatelet medications. No prospective data exist regarding the bleeding risk attributable to endoscopic biopsy in patients taking antiplatelet agents. A majority of Western endoscopists withdraw antiplatelet agents before upper endoscopy, despite expert guidelines to the contrary. We performed a prospective, single-blind, randomized study in healthy volunteers participating in a larger study regarding the effect of antiplatelet agents on gastroduodenal mucosal healing. Multiple gastroduodenal biopsies were performed during 2 esophagogastroduodenoscopy in subjects dosed with aspirin enteric-coated 81 mg once daily or clopidogrel 75 mg once daily. Data for endoscopic bleeding, clinical bleeding, blood vessel size, and depth of biopsy in histology specimens were collected. Four hundred and five antral biopsies and 225 duodenal biopsies were performed during 90 esophagogastroduodenoscopy in 45 subjects receiving aspirin or clopidogrel. Median maximum blood vessel diameter per biopsy was 31.9 ? (range: 9.2 to 133.8). About 50.8% of biopsy specimens breached the muscularis mucosa. In the clopidogrel group, no bleeding events were noted after 350 biopsies [upper confidence limit (UCL) for probability of bleeding=0.0085]. In the aspirin group, there were no clinical events (UCL=0.0106) and one minor endoscopic bleeding event (UCL=0.0169). Consistent with expert guidelines, the absolute risk attributable to gastroduodenal biopsy in adults taking antiplatelet agents seems to be low. Half of routine biopsies enter submucosa. The largest blood vessels avulsed during biopsy correspond to midsized and large arterioles and venules.

Routine management of stricture after gastric bypass and predictors of subsequent weight loss.
Gastrojejunal anastomotic stricture is the most commonly occurring short-term complication after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Endoscopic balloon dilation is the first-line treatment for stricture. However, an optimal dilation protocol has not been identified. This study aimed to document routine management of stricture after laparoscopic gastric bypass and its impact on postoperative weight loss. Charts of patients who underwent gastric bypass from 2000 to 2006 were reviewed using a standardized abstraction form. Patients with stricture were matched with control subjects based on age +/-5 years, gender, and preoperative body mass index (BMI +/- 5). Patients with at least 6 months of follow-up assessment were included in the study. Of the 113 patients included in the study, 20% were male, 26% black, 19% Hispanic, and 51% white. Their mean age was 42 +/- 10 years (range, 22-66 years). The mean preoperative BMI was 47.0 +/- 5.4 kg/m(2) for the case group and 46.6 +/- 5.5 kg/m(2) for the control group (p = 0.3). After adjustment for patient characteristics, using a larger balloon was associated with reduced odds of stricture recurrence (odds ratio [OR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.85; p = 0.02). All the patients were without signs or symptoms of stricture at the last follow-up visit (20 +/- 17 months). Weight loss was similar between the two groups. The percentage of estimated weight loss (%EWL) at 12 months postoperatively was 66% for the study participants and 67% for the control subjects (p = 0.5). Baseline alcohol use and higher preoperative BMI were associated with a higher BMI 6 months postoperatively (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively). Initial dilation with a larger balloon is safe and may prevent stricture recurrence. Further study of modifiable risk factors for reduced weight loss after surgery, such as alcohol use, may improve patient outcomes.

Primary prevention of adverse gastroduodenal effects from short-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs by omeprazole 20 mg in healthy subjects: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
The effectiveness of low-dose omeprazole as primary prevention of gastrointestinal adverse events due to episodic use of non-selective NSAIDs was evaluated. Healthy adults aged 50-75 who did not take chronic NSAIDs were randomized to a 6.5-day treatment of naproxen 500 mg twice daily plus omeprazole 20 mg daily or naproxen 500 mg twice daily plus placebo. Seventy subjects were enrolled (mean age 58.6 years, proportion >60 = 41.4%). Subjects receiving naproxen plus omeprazole developed fewer gastroduodenal ulcers compared to subjects receiving naproxen plus placebo (11.8% vs. 46.9%, P = 0.002). Likewise, naproxen plus omeprazole was associated with a decreased risk of ulceration and/or >5 erosions (38.2% vs. 81.3%, P < or = 0.001), and a smaller change in dyspepsia score. Considering their relatively low cost, ready availability, and favorable safety profile, low-dose PPI co-prescription in healthy adults requiring short-term therapy with non-selective NSAIDs may be reasonable.
