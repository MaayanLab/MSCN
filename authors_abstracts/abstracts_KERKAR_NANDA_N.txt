Recurrent intrahepatic pigmented stones after liver transplantation in a patient with hemoglobin SC disease: Case report and review of the literature.
Tomaino J, Keegan T, Kerkar N, Facciuto M, Miloh T, Taouli B, Hurlet A, Weintraub J, Sejpal D, Arnon R. Recurrent intrahepatic pigmented stones after liver transplantation in a patient with hemoglobin SC disease: Case report and review of the literature. Pediatr Transplantation 2011. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? Patients with hemoglobinopathies may have hepatic involvement, which if severe, can lead to chronic liver disease and a need for liver transplant. Here, we present a case of a 16-yr-old female adolescent who presented to our center with hemoglobin SC disease, obstructive jaundice because of pigmented intrahepatic biliary stones, and progressive liver disease. She underwent a successful liver transplant but a few years later, she developed recurrent cholangitis and graft dysfunction because of recurrent intrahepatic biliary stones. Recurrent formation of intrahepatic stones after liver transplant is a rare and severe complication in patients with hemoglobinopathies. We recommend hypertransfusion therapy and surveillance imaging studies after liver transplant for early detection and prevention of this complication.

Arnon R, Annunziato R, Miloh T, Wasserstein M, Sogawa H, Wilson M, Suchy F, Kerkar N. Liver transplantation for hereditary tyrosinemia type I: Analysis of the UNOS database. Pediatr Transplantation 2011: 15: 400-405. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? Patients with HT-1 can develop progressive liver disease and have a high incidence of HCC. LT is indicated in patients with fulminant liver failure, HCC or decompensated chronic liver disease refractory to NTBC. To determine the need for LT and outcomes after LT in children with HT-1. Children with HT-1 who had LT between 10/1987 and 5/2008 were identified from the UNOS database. Of 11?467 children in the UNOS database, 125 (1.1%) required LT secondary to HT-1. Mean age at LT was two and half yr (s.d.?±?3.6?yr). Mean age at LT during the first 10?yr of the study (1.82, s.d.?±?2.86?yr) was significantly lower than in the last decade (3.70, s.d.?±?4.42?yr), p?=?0.01. Nearly half of the patients (58, 46.4%) were transplanted between 1988 and 1992. Overall, one- and five-yr patient survival was 90.4% and 90.4%, respectively. LT is a valuable option for children with HT-1 with fulminant liver failure or when medical treatment fails. The rate of LT for children with HT-1 has decreased and age at transplant increased over the last decade most probably reflecting the effect of early diagnosis and treatment with NTBC.

Arnon R, Annunziato RA, Miloh T, Padilla M, Sogawa H, Batemarco L, Willis A, Suchy F, Kerkar N. Liver and combined lung and liver transplantation for cystic fibrosis: Analysis of the UNOS database. Pediatr Transplantation 2011: 15: 254-264. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? A proportion of patients with CF develop cirrhosis and portal hypertension. LT and combined LLT are rarely performed in patients with CF. To determine the outcome of LT and LLT in patients with CF. Patients with CF who had LT or LLT between 10/1987 and 5/2008 were identified from UNOS database. A total of 182 children (<18?yr) and 48 adults underwent isolated LT for CF. Seven more children and eight adults with CF underwent combined LLT. One- and five-yr patient and graft survival were not significantly different in patients who underwent LT in comparison with patients who underwent LLT (patient survival: LT; 83.9%, 75.7%, LLT; 80%, 80%; graft survival: LT; 76.1%, 67.0%, LLT; 80.0%, 80.0%, respectively). The two major causes of death after LT were pulmonary disease (15 patients, 22.7%) and hemorrhage (12 patients, 18.2%). Bilirubin was identified as a risk factor for death, and previous liver transplant and prolonged cold ischemic time were identified as risk factors for graft loss in LT patients. LT is a viable option for children and young adults with CF and end-stage liver disease. Outcome of LLT patients with CF was comparable to the outcome of patients with CF who underwent isolated LT.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome in children - is conventional liver transplantation always needed?
Willis AD, Miloh TA, Arnon R, Iyer KR, Suchy FJ, Kerkar N. Hepatopulmonary syndrome in children - is conventional liver transplantation always needed? Clin Transplant 2010 DOI: 10.1111/j.1399-0012.2010.01378.x. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? Background:? Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is the association of liver disease, hypoxemia, and intrapulmonary vascular dilatations. There are little data on the management of HPS in children other than conventional orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Aims:? To describe the patient characteristics, mode of diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of children with HPS at our center. Methods:? Retrospective review of patients diagnosed with HPS between 1997 and 2007 after IRB approval. Results:? There were 10 patients, six females; median age at diagnosis of HPS was 12?yr. Six with cirrhosis underwent OLT and had subsequent resolution of HPS and are stable at last follow-up. Of the remaining four, two had cirrhosis. HPS resolved without conventional OLT in the following four patients: hepatitis C after antiviral treatment, biliary atresia with portal hypertension after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting, Abernethy syndrome after auxiliary partial OLT, and in a child with splenic vein thrombosis after splenectomy. Conclusions:? Our series shows resolution of HPS in all patients and 100% survival after conventional OLT. Four children had resolution of HPS after surgical or medical treatments other than conventional OLT. Careful review of clinical status and underlying pathophysiology and anatomy at diagnosis of HPS should inform treatment decisions.

Liver transplantation for children with Wilson disease: comparison of outcomes between children and adults.
Liver transplantation (LT) is lifesaving for patients with Wilson disease (WD) presenting with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) or chronic liver disease (CLD) unresponsive to treatment. To determine the outcome of LT in pediatric and adult patients with WD. United Network for Organ Sharing data on LT from 1987 to 2008 were analyzed. Outcomes were compared for patients requiring LT for FHF and CLD after 2002. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for death and graft loss. Of 90,867 patients transplanted between 1987 and 2008, 170 children and 400 adults had WD. The one- and five-yr patient survival of children was 90.1% and 89% compared to 88.3% and 86% for adults, p = 0.53, 0.34. After 2002, 103 (41 children) were transplanted for FHF and 67 (10 children) for CLD. One- and five-yr patient survival was higher in children transplanted for CLD compared to FHF; 100%, 100% vs. 90%, 87.5% respectively, p = 0.30, 0.32. One- and five-yr patient survival was higher in adults transplanted for CLD compared to FHF; 94.7%, 90.1% vs. 90.3%, 89.7%, respectively, p = 0.36, 0.88. Encephalopathy, partial graft, and ventilator use were risk factors for death by logistic regression. LT is an excellent treatment option for patients with WD. Patients transplanted for CLD had higher patient survival rates than patients with FHF.

Roux-en-Y loop varices in children with portal hypertension after liver transplantation: An unusual cause of "obscure" gastrointestinal bleeding.
Chu J, Kerkar N, Miloh TA, Rodriguez-Laiz G, Lewis B, Stangl A, Newton KP, Iyer K, Arnon R. Roux-en-Y loop varices in children with portal hypertension after liver transplantation: An unusual cause of "obscure" gastro intestinal bleeding. Pediatr Transplantation 2010: (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract: PHALT may result from graft dysfunction, portal vein thrombosis, arterio-venous fistulas and can lead to GIB, commonly from bleeding esophageal varices. We present three children with GIB requiring multiple blood transfusions that were diagnosed with RY Loop bleeding. Routine EGD, colonoscopy, and CE failed to reveal the bleeding source. However, enteroscopy revealed large varices at the site of hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis in all. Our experience demonstrates that RY loop varices in children with PHALT are a rare and treatable cause of obscure GI bleeding.

Liver transplantation in children with metabolic diseases: the studies of pediatric liver transplantation experience.
Metabolic diseases are the second largest indication for LT in children after BA. There are limited data on the long-term post-transplant outcome in this unique group of patients. Therefore, our aim was to assess post-liver transplant outcomes and to evaluate risk factors for mortality and graft loss in children with metabolic disorders in comparison to those with non-metabolic diagnoses. We reviewed all patients enrolled in the SPLIT registry. Between 1995 and 2008, 446 of 2997 (14.9%) children enrolled in SPLIT underwent liver transplant for metabolic diseases. One-yr and five-yr patient survival for children with metabolic diseases was 94.6% and 88.9% and for those with other diseases 90.7% and 86.1% (log-rank p = 0.05), respectively. One-yr and five-yr graft survival for children with metabolic disorders was 90.8% and 83.8%, and for those with other diseases 85.4% and 78.0% (log-rank p = 0.005), respectively. Children with metabolic diseases were less likely to experience gastrointestinal complications (5.6% vs. 10.7%, p = 0.001), portal vein thrombosis (2.9% vs. 5.2%, p = 0.04), and reoperations within 30 days post-transplant (33.4% vs. 37.8%, p = 0.05) than those with other indications. In conclusion, children who underwent liver transplant for metabolic disease had similarly excellent patient survival as, and better graft survival than, those who received a liver allograft for other indications.

Sclerosing cholangitis: pediatric perspective.
Sclerosing cholangitis is a rare progressive cholestatic liver disease affecting the biliary tract. It may be associated with other diseases including autoimmune hepatitis, immunodeficiencies, cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell disease. Sclerosing cholangitis not associated with other diseases is termed "primary sclerosing cholangitis," which has a strong association with male gender, Caucasian race, and inflammatory bowel disease. Diagnosis is based on typical biochemical, radiologic, and histologic features. Medical management is directed mainly at managing complications (pruritus, cholangitis, strictures, and nutritional deficiencies). Administration of ursodeoxycholic acid results in biochemical improvement, but has not been proven to prolong transplant-free survival. Patients with autoimmune overlap respond to immunosuppression. The disease is typically progressive and evolves to biliary cirrhosis and possibly cholangiocarcinoma. Orthotopic liver transplantation remains the only life-extending alternative for patients with sclerosing cholangitis, with good long-term patient and graft survival, and recurrent graft primary sclerosing cholangitis in about 10% of children.

Orthotopic liver transplantation for children with Alagille syndrome.
AGS is an inherited disorder involving the liver, heart, eyes, face, and skeleton. Aim: To determine the outcome of LT in children with AGS compared to those with BA. Methods: Children with AGS and BA who had a LT between 10/1987 and 5/2008 were identified from the UNOS database. Results: Of 11 467 children who received a liver transplant, 461 (4.0%) had AGS and 3056 (26.7%) had BA. One- and five-yr patient survival was significantly lower in patients with AGS in comparison with patients with BA (AGS; 82.9%, 78.4%, BA; 89.9%, 84%, respectively). Early death (<30 days from transplant) was significantly higher in AGS than in BA. One- and five-yr graft survival was significantly lower in AGS than in BA (AGS; 74.7%, 61.5%, BA; 81.6%, 70.0%, respectively). Death from graft failure, neurological, and cardiac complications was significantly higher in patients with AGS than in patients with BA. Serum creatinine at transplant, prior LT, and cold ischemic time >12 h were identified as risk factors for death. Conclusion: Children with AGS were older at the time of LT and their one- and five-yr patient and graft survival were significantly lower compared to BA. Risk factors for poor outcome in AGS after LT were identified.

The changing face of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease in the era of molecular EBV monitoring.
Pediatric PTLD is often associated with primary EBV infection and immunosuppression. The aim was to retrospectively review the spectrum of histologically documented PTLD for two time intervals differentiated by changes in use of molecular EBV monitoring. Eleven of 146 patients (7.5%) in 2001-2005 (Era A) and 10 of 92 (10.9%) in 1993-1997 (Era B) were diagnosed with PTLD. The median age at liver transplantation (0.8 and 0.9 yr, respectively) and the median duration between liver transplant and diagnosis of PTLD (0.6 and 0.7 yr, respectively) were similar in both eras. However, patients in Era A presented with significantly less advanced histological disease compared to patients in Era B (p=0.03). Specifically, nine patients (82%) in Era A had Pl hyperplasia/polymorphic PTLD, whereas in Era B, six had advanced histological disease (five monomorphic and one unclassified). Three transplant recipients in Era B died secondary to PTLD, whereas there were no PTLD-related deaths in Era A (p=0.03). Heightened awareness of risk for PTLD, alterations in baseline immunosuppression regimens, implementation of molecular EBV monitoring, pre-emptive reduction in immunosuppression and improved therapeutic options may have all contributed to a milder PTLD phenotype and improved clinical outcomes.

Surgical portosystemic shunts and the Rex bypass in children: a single-centre experience.
This study aimed to illustrate the indications for, and types and outcomes of surgical portosystemic shunt (PSS) and/or Rex bypass in a single centre. Data were collected from children with a PSS and/or Rex bypass between 1992 and 2006 at Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York. Median age at surgery was 10.7 years (range 0.3-22.0 years). Indications included: (i) refractory gastrointestinal bleeding in portal hypertension associated with (a) compensated cirrhosis (n= 12), (b) portal vein thrombosis (n= 10), (c) hepatoportal sclerosis (n= 3); (ii) refractory ascites secondary to Budd-Chiari syndrome (n= 3), and (iii) familial hypercholesterolaemia (n= 4). There were 20 distal splenorenal, four portacaval, three Rex bypass, two mesocaval, two mesoatrial and one proximal splenorenal shunts. At the last follow-up (median 2.9 years, range 0.1-14.1 years), one shunt (Rex bypass) was thrombosed. Two patients had died and two had required a liver transplant. These had a patent shunt at last imaging prior to death or transplant. Portosystemic shunts and Rex bypass have been used to manage portal hypertension with excellent outcomes. In selected children with compensated liver disease, PSS may act as a bridge to liver transplantation or represent an attractive alternative.

Chronic rejection preceded by central perivenulitis, rapidly ensuing after liver transplantation in a pediatric patient.
A 15-year-old boy who underwent liver transplantation for fulminant Wilson's disease, presented with elevated transaminases 2 months post-transplant. He had recently seroconverted from previous Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) naive status and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) had increasing viral load copies of EBV in blood. A liver biopsy was obtained 6 weeks post-transplant, which showed isolated central perivenulitis (CP). His immunosuppresion was reduced and antiviral therapy was added with subsequent increase in liver transaminases. A second liver biopsy 6 weeks later again showed isolated CP. Subsequent further reduction in immunosuppression was followed by the appearance of portal-based moderate acute cellular rejection that was resistant to immunosuppressive treatment and rapidly evolved into ductopenic chronic rejection. This case report underlines the difficulties in interpreting isolated perivenulitis, especially in the setting of EBV seroconversion, and suggests that it may not only represent a form of acute rejection but also a predictor of rapidly progressing chronic rejection.

Issues unique to pediatric liver transplantation.
Liver transplantation in pediatrics has become an accepted modality of treatment in end-stage liver disease and irreversible acute liver failure. Biliary atresia is the most common indication requiring liver transplantation in children. The diagnosis and causes of acute liver failure in children differ from those in adults. Growth and development require special consideration in children. Regular surveillance of Epstein-Barr virus by polymerase chain reaction and appropriate therapy may reduce the incidence of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease after transplantation. Adherence to the prescribed medical regimen is essential for good graft function. A multidisciplinary approach is the key to success in liver transplantation in children.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome after Mycoplasma pneumonia infection in pediatric post-liver transplant recipient: Case report and review of the literature.
Tomaino J, Keegan T, Miloh T, Kerkar N, Mercer S, Birge M, Rocca J, Suchy F, Arnon R. Stevens-Johnson syndrome after Mycoplasma pneumonia infection in pediatric post-liver transplant recipient: case report and review of the literature. Pediatr Transplantation 2010. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? Although Mycoplasma pneumonia infection is relatively common among school-aged children, it rarely leads to SJS. Herein, we report a seven-yr-old girl who presented with a Mycoplasma pneumonia infection that progressed to SJS five months after liver transplant. We suggest that children presenting with symptoms of Mycoplasma pneumonia infection in the immunosuppressed post-liver transplant setting be properly diagnosed and treated rapidly, as well as observed for symptoms of SJS and potentially serious extrapulmonary complications.

Improving adherence to medications in pediatric liver transplant recipients.
We describe results from a clinical program, which aimed at improving adherence to medications in children who had a liver transplant. We followed the medical outcomes of 23 children and adolescents who participated in a clinical adherence-improvement protocol during the years 2001-2002. The protocol included identification of non-adherent patients by examining tacrolimus blood levels and intervention by increasing the frequency of clinic visits for non-adherent patients. In the two-yr preintervention (1999-2000), there was no improvement in any of the outcomes. After the intervention, the number of patients with high alanine aminotransferase levels (100 and above) decreased significantly, from eight before the intervention to four afterwards. Other outcomes, including the number of rejection episodes (three before, none after) and the degree of adherence to tacrolimus, also improved, but the improvement did not reach statistical significance. Although non-adherent patients were called to clinic more often under the protocol, the intervention did not lead to increased outpatient costs. This adherence--improvement intervention appears to be promising in improving outcomes in pediatric liver transplant recipients. Larger, controlled studies are needed to establish the efficacy of this or other approaches.
