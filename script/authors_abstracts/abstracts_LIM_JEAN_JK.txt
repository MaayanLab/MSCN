Chemokine control of West Nile virus infection.
West Nile virus (WNV) is a re-emerging pathogen responsible for fatal outbreaks of meningoencephalitis in humans. Recent research using a mouse model of infection has indicated that specific chemokines and chemokine receptors help mediate the host response to WNV acting by at least three mechanisms: control of early neutrophil recruitment to the infection site (Cxcr2), control of monocytosis in blood (Ccr2) and control of leukocyte movement from blood to brain (Cxcr4, Cxcr3, Cxcl10 and possibly Ccr5). CCR5 also appears to be important in human infection, since individuals genetically deficient in this receptor have increased risk of symptomatic disease once infected. These findings provide detailed insight into non-redundant chemokine roles in organ-specific leukocyte recruitment during infection, and emphasize the importance of the balance between pathogen control and immunopathology in determining overall clinical outcome.
