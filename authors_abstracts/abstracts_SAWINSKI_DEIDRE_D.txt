25-OH-vitamin D deficiency and cellular alloimmunity as measured by panel of reactive T cell testing in dialysis patients.
Primed antidonor alloreactive T cells are detrimental to transplant outcome, but factors that impact the strength of this immune response prior to transplantation are unknown. We tested peripheral blood mononuclear cells from dialysis patients, against panels of allogeneic, primary B-cell lines in a newly standardized IFN? ELISPOT panel of reactive T cell (PRT) assay. Results were correlated with known alloantibody-sensitizing events and other clinical parameters. As 25-OH-vitamin D deficiency is associated with enhanced cellular immunity, is common in dialysis patients and is correctable, we assessed the relationship between serum 25-OH-vitamin D and the PRT. Using independent test and validation cohorts we found that low serum levels of 25-OH-vitamin D (<26 ng/mL) correlated with high-PRT values (in the upper 50th percentile, OR 0.02, p = 0.01) independent of age, sex, race, previous transplant, transfusion, pregnancy, time on dialysis, panel of reactive antibody, iPTH, and treatment with 1,25-OH-vitamin D. The data provide a potential mechanism for the possible relationship between vitamin D deficiency and poor posttransplant outcome, and support studies to test the impact of 25-OH-vitamin D repletion on alloimmunity and allograft injury in kidney transplant candidates.

Factors associated with failure to list HIV-positive kidney transplant candidates.
With improved survival in the antiretroviral era, data from ongoing studies suggest that HIV patients can be safely transplanted. The disproportionate burden of HIV-related end-stage renal disease in minority populations may impose additional obstacles to successful completion of the transplant evaluation. We retrospectively reviewed 309 potentially eligible HIV patients evaluated for kidney transplant at our institution since 2000. Only 20% of HIV patients have been listed, compared to 73% of HIV-negative patients evaluated over the same period (p < 0.00001). Failure to provide documentation of CD4 and viral load (36% of candidates) was the most common reason for failure to progress beyond initial evaluation. Other factors independently associated with failure to complete the evaluation included CD4 < 200 at initial evaluation (OR 15.17; 95% CI 1.94-118.83), black race (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.07-5.06), and history of drug use (OR 2.56; 95% CI 1.22-5.37). More efficient medical record sharing and an awareness of factors associated with failure to list HIV-positive transplant candidates may enable transplant centers to more effectively advocate for these patients.
