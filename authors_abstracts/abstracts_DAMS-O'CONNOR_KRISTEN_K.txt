Role and impact of cognitive rehabilitation.
Cognitive rehabilitation interventions are theoretically based and empirically validated treatments designed to ameliorate the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional impairments commonly experienced by individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Cognitive rehabilitation can play many roles in facilitating recovery after TBI, such as improving impaired cognitive functions, increasing awareness of injury-related deficits, improving mood, facilitating vocational and community involvement, and reducing the probability of secondary disability. The considerable evidence documenting the impact of cognitive rehabilitation on improving the day-to-day function of individuals with TBI is described.
