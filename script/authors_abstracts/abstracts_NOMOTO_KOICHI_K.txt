Recognition of a cleft mitral valve utilizing real-time three-dimensional transoesophageal echocardiography.
We present a case in which real-time three-dimensional transoesophageal echocardiography was utilized to obtain better understanding of a cleft mitral valve. Additionally, the embryological development of a cleft mitral valve will be reiterated.

Intracardiac thrombosis and acute right ventricular failure following complex reoperative cardiac surgery with aprotinin and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
Although coagulopathy and bleeding are common in the setting of cardiac surgery, a growing number of case reports in the literature suggest that hypercoagulability may also result in significant morbidity and mortality. We present a case of apparent hypercoagulability with formation of thrombus in the cardiac chambers following reoperative cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass, aprotinin, and deep hypothermic arrest. A review of those hypercoagulable disorders with reported impact on cardiac surgery and a discussion follow the case presentation.
