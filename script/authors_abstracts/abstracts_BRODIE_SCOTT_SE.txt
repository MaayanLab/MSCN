Intra-arterial Chemotherapy for the Management of Retinoblastoma: Four-Year Experience.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether intra-arterial chemotherapy is safe and effective in advanced intraocular retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma often presents with advanced intraocular disease and, despite conventional treatment with intravenous chemotherapy and external beam radiation therapy, may still require enucleation. DESIGN: Single-arm, prospective registry from May 30, 2006, to May 30, 2010, at an ophthalmic oncology referral center with ambulatory care. A total of 95 eyes of 78 patients with unilateral or bilateral retinoblastoma were treated. The intervention was selective catheterization of the ophthalmic artery and injection of chemotherapy, usually melphalan with or without topotecan. Drug dosage was determined by age and angioanatomy. The main outcome measures were procedural success, event-free (enucleation or radiotherapy) ocular survival, and ocular and extraocular complications. RESULTS: Catheterization succeeded in 98.5% of procedures. There were 289 chemotherapy injections (median, 3 per eye). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of ocular event-free survival rates at 2 years were 70.0% (95% confidence interval, 57.9%-82.2%) for all eyes, 81.7% (95% confidence interval, 66.8%-96.6%) for eyes that received intra-arterial chemotherapy as primary treatment, and 58.4% (95% confidence interval, 39.5%-77.2%) for eyes that had previous treatment failure with intravenous chemotherapy and/or external beam radiation therapy. There were no permanent extraocular complications. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that intra-arterial chemotherapy is safe and effective in the treatment of advanced intraocular retinoblastoma.

Supranormal electroretinogram in a 10-year-old girl with lead toxicity.
To report a case of lead exposure in a 10-year-old girl which resulted in a supranormal ERG and clinical findings of decreased visual acuity, color vision, and stereopsis. Case report. A 10-year-old girl was exposed to unknown levels of lead, with peak recorded blood levels of 19 mcg/dl 5 years prior to presentation. Lead levels had since normalized. Uncorrected visual acuity was 20/200-OU, improving to 20/80-OU with a refractive correction of +1.50 + 0.75 x 90 degrees OD, +2.50 sphere OS. Color vision was tested with Ishihara plates, and appeared markedly impaired. Stereopsis was grossly impaired, as the patient could not perceive stereoscopic depth with the Titmus "fly" target. Her cognitive function appeared to be slowed and her reaction time also delayed. ERG waveforms were supranormal under photopic and scotopic conditions. Implicit times were normal. Lead toxicity with significant visual and cognitive dysfunction, and supranormal ERG, can persist at lead levels below those recognized for lead poisoning.
