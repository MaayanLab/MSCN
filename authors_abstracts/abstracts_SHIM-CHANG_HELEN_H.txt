Necrolytic migratory erythema associated with a metastatic neuroendocrine tumor.
Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME) is a skin condition historically associated with pancreatic glucagonomas. Rarely it occurs in the absence of a pancreatic tumor, which has been described as pseudoglucagonoma syndrome. We describe a woman with a metastatic neuroendocrine tumor who developed NME 6 years after diagnosis of the tumor. Her laboratory data revealed essential fatty acid deficiency and a high level of glucagon. Although the pathogenesis of NME is not completely understood, zinc, essential amino acid, and fatty acid deficiencies have all been postulated as possible causative factors.
