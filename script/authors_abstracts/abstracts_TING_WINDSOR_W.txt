Endovascular treatment of visceral artery aneurysms.
Visceral artery aneurysms, although uncommon, can present with life-threatening hemorrhage. The increasing use of imaging studies has allowed for earlier identification and intervention of these aneurysms, thus avoiding the high morbidity and mortality associated with rupture. The treatment options for visceral artery aneurysms range from conventional open surgical repair to minimally invasive techniques using covered stents or embolization materials. Anatomic features and patient selection determine which treatment option would result in the most durable treatment and outcome. This article reviews our experience with the endovascular treatment of visceral artery aneurysms.
