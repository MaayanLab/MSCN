Using a brief 10-item generic measure of quality of life in English and Spanish speaking diabetic patients.
Validation of the Multicultural Quality of Life Index (MQLI), a 10-item self-rated generic multilingual quality of life (QOL) measure in ethnically-diverse diabetic patients. Diabetic adult patients (n = 180) in New York City completed the MQLI, English or Spanish version. Its internal consistency, factorial structure, and construct validity were analyzed. Depression screening (PHQ-9) scores were used to divide subjects into two sub-samples with presumed different QOL levels. A Cronbach's alpha of 0.92 demonstrated its internal consistency (English-version = 0.90, Spanish-version = 0.94). A one-single factor structure was documented (all items loadings > or = 0.64), accounting for 59% of the items variance in the total sample; similar results were found for each language version. Correlation of the MQLI and PHQ-9 scores yielded an r = -0.58. Mild negative correlations with self-disclosed diagnosis of depression or other mental disorders, diabetes duration, and abnormal sensation on foot exam were found, but were non-significant with other diabetes aspects (e.g., HbA1c, retinopathy). A significant difference (p < 0.001) between the scores of two subsamples with presumed different levels of QOL (means = 8.02 vs. 5.84) was found. Conclusions: The MQLI demonstrated coherence around the QOL concept. It correlated significantly with mental health (particularly depression), duration of diabetes, and possible neuropathy, but not with some diabetes-related factors. Its use in diabetic care settings is recommended, possibly supplemented by QOL diabetic-specific instruments.
