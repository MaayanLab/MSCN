Two Sorting Motifs, a Ubiquitination Motif and a Tyrosine Motif, Are Involved in HIV-1 and Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Nef-Mediated Receptor Endocytosis.
HIV-1 and SIV Nef proteins downregulate cell surface CD4 and MHC class I (MHC-I) molecules of infected cells, which are necessary for efficient viral replication and pathogenicity. We previously reported that K144 in HIV-1 Nef is di-ubiquitinated, and K144R substitution impairs Nef-mediated CD4 downregulation. In this report, we extend the role of ubiquitination at this lysine residue from Nef-mediated CD4 downregulation to Nef-mediated MHC-I downregulation and from HIV Nef to SIV Nef. All HIV-1 Nef mutants that contain K144R substitution are inactive in MHC-I downregulation. Tested MHC-I alleles include HLA-ABC endogenously expressed and HLA-A2 exogenously expressed in Jurkat T cells. CD4 downregulation by SIV Nef involves K176 that aligns with K144 in HIV-1 Nef, as well as an N-terminal tyrosine motif Y28Y39 not present in HIV-1 Nef. Dual mutation at K176 and Y28Y39 completely impaired SIV Nef-mediated CD4 and MHC-I downregulation, whereas a single mutation at K176 or Y28Y39 did not. The involvement of tyrosine motif in SIV Nef-mediated CD4 and MHC-I downregulation prompted us to investigate a putative tyrosine motif (Y202Y/F203) in HIV-1 Nef that is conserved among HIV-1 species. Single mutation at the tyrosine motif Y202F203 in HIV-1 Nef (NA7) greatly impaired Nef-mediated CD4 downregulation, which is similar to what we observed previously with the single mutation at lysine K144. Thus, our study demonstrated that Nef-mediated receptor endocytosis involves the ubiquitination motif and tyrosine motif.

Alkylating HIV-1 Nef - a potential way of HIV intervention.
ABSTRACT: Nef is a 27 KDa HIV-1 accessory protein. It downregulates CD4 from infected cell surface, a mechanism critical for efficient viral replication and pathogenicity. Agents that antagonize the Nef-mediated CD4 downregulation may offer a new class of drug to combat HIV infection and disease. TPCK (N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone) and TLCK (N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone) are alkylation reagents that chemically modify the side chain of His or Cys residues in a protein. In search of chemicals that inhibit Nef function, we discovered that TPCK and TLCK alkylated HIV Nef. Nef modification by TPCK was demonstrated on reducing SDS-PAGE. The specific cysteine residues modified were determined by site-directed mutagenesis and mass spectrometry (MS). The effect of TPCK modification on Nef-CD4 interaction was studied using fluorescence titration of a synthetic CD4 tail peptide with recombinant Nef-His protein. The conformational change of Nef-His protein upon TPCK-modification was monitored using CD spectrometry Incubation of Nef-transfected T cells, or recombinant Nef-His protein, with TPCK resulted in mobility shift of Nef on SDS-PAGE. Mutagenesis analysis indicated that the modification occurred at Cys55 and Cys206 in Nef. Mass spectrometry demonstrated that the modification was a covalent attachment (alkylation) of TPCK at Cys55 and Cys206. Cys55 is next to the CD4 binding motif (A56W57L58) in Nef required for Nef-mediated CD4 downregulation and for AIDS development. This implies that the addition of a bulky TPCK molecule to Nef at Cys55 would impair Nef function and reduce HIV pathogenicity. As expected, Cys55 modification reduced the strength of the interaction between Nef-His and CD4 tail peptide by 50%. Our data suggest that this Cys55-specific alkylation mechanism may be exploited to develop a new class of anti HIV drugs.
