The Mdm2-p53 relationship evolves: Mdm2 swings both ways as an oncogene and a tumor suppressor.
Mdm2 has been well characterized as a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor p53. Recent studies have shown that Mdm2 is activated in response to a variety of oncogenic pathways independent of p53. Although its role as an oncogene via suppression of p53 function remains clear, growing evidence argues for p53-independent effects, as well as the remarkable possibility that Mdm2 has tumor suppressor functions in the appropriate context. Hence, Mdm2 is proving to be a key player in human cancer in its own right, and thus an important target for therapeutic intervention.

Skp2B attenuates p53 function by inhibiting prohibitin.
The F-box protein Skp2 and its isoform Skp2B are both overexpressed in breast cancers. Skp2 alters the activity of p53 by inhibiting its interaction with p300 and by promoting p300 degradation. Here, we report that Skp2B also attenuates the activity of p53; however, this effect is independent of p300, suggesting that another mechanism might be involved. Prohibitin, a protein reported to activate p53, was isolated in a two-hybrid screen with the carboxy-terminal domain unique to Skp2B. We observed that prohibitin is a new substrate of Skp2B and that the degradation of prohibitin is responsible for the attenuated activity of p53 in cells overexpressing Skp2B. Furthermore, we show that the activity of p53 is reduced in the mammary glands of Skp2B transgenic mice. This study indicates that both Skp2 and Skp2B attenuate p53 activity through different pathways, suggesting that amplification of the Skp2 locus represents a powerful mechanism to attenuate p53 function in cancer.

Insights from a novel p53 isoform in zebrafish want to reel us in, but will we take the bait?
The p53 tumor suppressor has been reported to be expressed as multiple isoforms. In this issue of Genes & Development, Chen and colleagues (pp. 278-290) use a zebrafish model to show that one such isoform, Delta113p53, is a target for transcriptional activation by p53 and can, in turn, inhibit the activity of the full-length p53 protein, establishing a novel negative feedback loop centered on the p53 locus itself. The challenge will be to determine whether these intriguing results in zebrafish will pave the way for new insights into several perplexing issues in p53 biology that will impact human disease.

Inappropriate activation of cyclin-dependent kinases by the phosphatase Cdc25b results in premature mitotic entry and triggers a p53-dependent checkpoint.
The dual specificity phosphatase Cdc25B is capable of inhibiting cellular proliferation, and this occurs in a manner dependent upon its catalytic activity. Here it is shown that this is accompanied by inappropriate cyclin-dependent kinase activation and premature mitotic entry, leading to both p53-dependent and independent checkpoints. Forced expression of Cdc25B inappropriately up-regulated the activity of Cdk1 and Cdk2, by reducing levels of inhibitory phosphorylation. In cells lacking p14ARF, p53 is induced, and components of the ATM and ATR pathways are activated. Cdc25B triggers cell cycle arrest in the G(1) and G(2) phases that is p53- and p21-dependent and is inhibited by caffeine. Cdc25B also causes cells with an S phase DNA content to enter mitosis prematurely in a p53-independent manner. Synchronization of cells with aphidicolin results in these cells undergoing apoptosis. Thus, inappropriate cell cycle progression and premature mitotic entry via dysregulation of cyclin-dependent kinases results in activation of both p53-dependent and independent responses. Because Cdc25B is known to have oncogenic activity, this provides insight into the multistep nature of cancer development and why there is p53 loss during tumorigenesis.

Cellular senescence and organismal ageing in the absence of p21(CIP1/WAF1) in ku80(-/-) mice.
Ku80 is important in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by its essential function in non-homologous end-joining. The absence of Ku80 causes the accumulation of DNA damage and leads to premature ageing in mice. We showed that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from ku80(-/-) mice senesced rapidly with elevated levels of p53 and p21. Deletion of p21 delayed the early senescence phenotype in ku80(-/-) MEFs, despite an otherwise intact response of p53. In contrast to ku80(-/-)p53(-/-) mice, which die rapidly primarily from lymphomas, there was no significant increase in tumorigenesis in ku80(-/-)p21(-/-) mice. However, ku80(-/-)p21(-/-) mice showed no improvement with respect to rough fur coat or osteopaenia, and even showed a shortened lifespan compared with ku80(-/-) mice. These results show that the increased lifespan of ku80(-/-) MEFs owing to the loss of p21 is not associated with an improvement of the premature ageing phenotypes of ku80(-/-) mice observed at the organismal level.

Overexpression of the dual specificity phosphatase, Cdc25C, confers sensitivity on tumor cells to doxorubicin-induced cell death.
Cdc25C is a dual-specificity phosphatase that is involved in induction of mitosis by removal of the inhibitory phosphates from cyclin-dependent kinase 1/cyclin B. In this study, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Cdc25C sensitizes U2OS tumor cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. U2OS cells that stably overexpress Cdc25C are also sensitized to doxorubicin-induced cell death. These cells show reduced phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 on Tyr15 and impaired up-regulation of p21 in response to treatment with doxorubicin. In contrast to doxorubicin, overexpression of Cdc25C does not confer sensitivity to apoptosis on treatment with 5-fluorouracil or hydroxyurea. This sensitization of tumor cells to doxorubicin-induced cell death by overexpression of Cdc25C is not p53 dependent. Intriguingly, nontransformed MCF10A cells are not sensitized to doxorubicin treatment by overexpression of Cdc25C nor does the lack of Cdc25C affect cell cycle progression or the G2 arrest caused by doxorubicin. These results support the idea that a combination of overexpressing Cdc25C with treatment with conventional genotoxic agents should be given serious considerations as a novel therapeutic strategy.

Mdm2 plays a positive role as an effector of p53-dependent responses.
The p53 tumor suppressor is negatively regulated in cells by the Mdm2 protein. Mdm2 has therefore been the focus of intensive research aiming at using it as a target for cancer therapy with the ultimate goal of restoring p53 activity. Several studies have attempted to ablate Mdm2 expression or disrupt its interaction with p53 in cancer cells. While the p53-Mdm2 duo has concentrated a lot of attention, multiple new and diverse functions and targets of Mdm2 have been uncovered. Downregulation of Mdm2 using an siRNA approach has recently provided evidence for a new role of Mdm2 in the p53 response, by modulating the inhibition of the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) by p21. Here, this and other recent findings are discussed that support a new role for Mdm2 in the regulation of p53 response.

The dual specificity phosphatase Cdc25B, but not the closely related Cdc25C, is capable of inhibiting cellular proliferation in a manner dependent upon its catalytic activity.
Cdc25B and Cdc25C are closely related dual specificity phosphatases that activate cyclin-dependent kinases by removal of inhibitory phosphorylations, thereby triggering entry into mitosis. Cdc25B, but not Cdc25C, has been implicated as an oncogene and been shown to be overexpressed in a variety of human tumors. Surprisingly, ectopic expression of Cdc25B, but not Cdc25C, inhibits cell proliferation in long term assays. Chimeric proteins generated from the two phosphatases show that the anti-proliferative activity is associated with the C-terminal end of Cdc25B. Indeed, the catalytic domain of Cdc25B is sufficient to suppress cell viability in a manner partially dependent upon its C-terminal 26 amino acids that is shown to influence substrate binding. Mutation analysis demonstrates that both the phosphatase activity of Cdc25B as well as its ability to interact with its substrates contribute to the inhibition of cell proliferation. These results demonstrate key differences in the biological activities of Cdc25B and Cdc25C caused by differential substrate affinity and recognition. This also argues that the antiproliferative activity of Cdc25B needs to be overcome for it to act as an oncogene during tumorigenesis.

Mdm2 is required for inhibition of Cdk2 activity by p21, thereby contributing to p53-dependent cell cycle arrest.
p53 is extensively posttranslationally modified in response to various types of cellular stress. Such modifications have been implicated in the regulation of p53 protein levels as well as its DNA binding and transcriptional activities. Treatment of cells with doxorubicin causes phosphorylation and acetylation of p53, transcriptional upregulation of p21 and other target genes, and growth arrest. In contrast, downregulation of Mdm2 by a small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach led to increased levels of p53 lacking phosphorylation at serine 15 and acetylation at lysine 382. Levels of binding of p53 to the p21 promoter were comparable following treatment with doxorubicin or Mdm2 siRNA. Moreover, p53 was transcriptionally active and capable of inducing or repressing a variety of its target genes. Surprisingly, p53 upregulated by Mdm2 siRNA had no effect on cell cycle progression. Although comparable in level to that achieved by treatment with the p53 activators actinomycin D and nutlin-3, the increases in p53 and p21 after downregulation of Mdm2 were not sufficient to trigger cell cycle arrest. This version of p21 was capable of interacting with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) but failed to inhibit its activity. Taken together, these results argue that Mdm2 is needed for full inhibition of Cdk2 activity by p21, thereby positively contributing to p53-dependent cell cycle arrest.
