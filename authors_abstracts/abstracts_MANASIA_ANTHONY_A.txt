Sinus bradycardia associated with daclizumab in liver transplant recipients: report of 3 cases.
Daclizumab is a commonly used immunosuppressive agent for prophylaxis of solid organ rejection. Although rare, the cardiovascular adverse effects of daclizumab include sinus tachycardia, hypotension, and hypertension. Here, we report 3 patients who developed significant and prolonged sinus bradycardia after receiving daclizumab following orthotopic liver transplant. Daclizumab should be considered a possible cause of bradycardia following its administration in orthotopic liver transplant.
