Premicroalbuminuria in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a metabolic risk marker.
To determine the relationship between urinary albumin excretion and features of the metabolic syndrome in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 189 premenopausal women (mean age +/- SD, 28.9 +/- 7.7 years) with PCOS and 81 control patients (mean age +/- SD, 37.9 +/- 8.6 years) from a single endocrinology practice. Exclusion criteria were diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, use of lipid-lowering agents, and use of antihypertensive agents (except spironolactone). The urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) was measured in a random single-voided urine sample. Premicroalbuminuria was defined as an ACR >7 mg/g. The prevalence of ACR >7 mg/g was 31.2% in the PCOS group (N = 189) and 35.8% in the control group (N = 81). The metabolic syndrome was noted in 16.3% (27 of 166) of patients with PCOS and in 2.9% (2 of 69) of control subjects. Nine percent of patients with PCOS who had an ACR <or=7 mg/g but 30.9% of those with an ACR >7 mg/g had the metabolic syndrome. Patients with PCOS who had an ACR >7 mg/g had significantly higher blood pressure and alanine aminotransferase levels than did those with an ACR <or=7 mg/g. In the patients with PCOS who had an ACR <or=7 mg/g versus those who had an ACR >7 mg/g, no significant difference was found in frequency of use of metformin, spironolactone, or oral contraceptives. In women with PCOS, an ACR >7 mg/g was strongly associated with the metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure, and elevated alanine aminotransferase levels. It may be useful to consider ACR >7 mg/g as an associated sign of the presence of metabolic syndrome in women with PCOS.

Polycystic ovary syndrome: a common reproductive and metabolic disorder necessitating early recognition and treatment.
Patients who have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) present with infertility, recurrent miscarriages, menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, and acne. Many also have metabolic and hormonal abnormalities that can significantly increase risk for coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and endometrial carcinoma. PCOS patients should be screened for obstructive sleep apnea. Early recognition may reverse physical signs of the disease, while correcting the metabolic abnormalities that can pose significant health risk if untreated. Although lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy are used to treat PCOS, there are few long-term outcome data regarding benefits of metabolic interventional strategies. Insulin sensitizers can improve ovulatory function, lower insulin resistance, lower androgen levels, and increase the likelihood of becoming pregnant. Further studies should yield other treatment options.

Obesity and the polycystic ovary syndrome.
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is extremely common among reproductive-aged women, but often goes undiagnosed. PCOS is associated with the metabolic syndrome and carries a greatly increased risk of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular risks. Treatment of PCOS may provide relief of cosmetic problems and depression by improving patient self-esteem. In addition, because of its association with the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease, its recognition and treatment can potentially be life saving. This article reviews the impact, pathophysiology, and associated risks of obesity and the metabolic syndrome in PCOS.
