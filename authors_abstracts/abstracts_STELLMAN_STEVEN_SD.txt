Reported residential pesticide use and breast cancer risk on Long Island, New York.
Pesticides, common environmental exposures, have been examined in relation to breast cancer primarily in occupational studies or exposure biomarker studies. No known studies have focused on self-reported residential pesticide use. The authors investigated the association between reported lifetime residential pesticide use and breast cancer risk among women living on Long Island, New York. They conducted a population-based case-control study of 1,508 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer between August 1996 and July 1997 and 1,556 randomly selected, age-frequency-matched controls. Comprehensive residential pesticide use and other risk factors were assessed by using an in-person, interviewer-administered questionnaire. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Breast cancer risk was associated with ever lifetime residential pesticide use (odds ratio = 1.39, 95% confidence interval: 1.15, 1.68). However, there was no evidence of increasing risk with increasing lifetime applications. Lawn and garden pesticide use was associated with breast cancer risk, but there was no dose response. Little or no association was found for nuisance-pest pesticides, insect repellents, or products to control lice or fleas and ticks on pets. This study is the first known to suggest that self-reported use of residential pesticides may increase breast cancer risk. Further investigation in other populations is necessary to confirm these findings.
