p53 gene mutations in SKH-1 mouse tumors differentially induced by UVB and combined subcarcinogenic benzo[a]pyrene and UVA.
We compared the frequency and spectra of p53 mutations in skin tumors from UVB-irradiated and benzo(a)pyrene-UVA-treated SKH-1 mice. Analysis of p53 mutations using a combination of polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and sequencing shows that the frequency and spectrum of p53 mutations in BaP-UVA-induced tumors are quite different from those in UVB-induced tumors. SKH-1 mice were treated with BaP-UVA or UVB for 30 weeks after which skin tumors were collected for analysis of p53 mutations. Among the 11 BaP-UVA-induced tumors with diameters of 5-10 mm, two displayed mutations in exon 8 yielding a mutation frequency of 18.2%. In contrast, the mutation frequency among BaP-UVA-induced tumors was 10.5%. In UVB-induced tumors, the mutation frequency in exon 8 was highly correlated with tumor size. A total of 77.8% of tumors with diameters larger than 10 mm contained p53 mutations. The overall mutation frequency among UVB-induced tumors was 17.9% in exon 8 and only 3.8% in exon 5. Hotspots for p53 mutation in UVB-induced tumors were found at codons 128 and 149 (exon 5), and at codons 268, 270, 271 and 273-276 (exon 8). In addition to widely recognized C-->T missense mutations, there were also tandem CC-->AG changes coupled with either an insertion of T, a C-->G substitution or G-->C/T mutations. All of the mutations were found at tri- or tetra-pyrimidine sites. Thirty-nine per cent of all p53 mutations occurred at codons 274 and 275; 53% occurred at codons 268-271. Two multiple mutation clusters were located at codons 268-271 and 274-276. Both BaP-UVA and UVB caused C-->T transitions at codon 275 in exon 8. A C-->T mutation at codon 294 was induced only by BaP-UVA treatment. In contrast to UVB treatment, BaP-UVA treatment did not induce any mutations in exon 5. We show that individually subcarcinogenic levels of BaP and UVA synergistically induce a novel p53-mutation fingerprint. This fingerprint could serve as a prognostic indicator for the development of BaP-UVA-induced skin tumors.

Water content and other aspects of brittle versus normal fingernails.
Previous authors have claimed that dehydration of the nail plate causes brittle nails. Some experts claim that normal nails contain 18% water, and brittle nails contain less than 16%. We sought to test the hypothesis that brittle nails contain 2% less water than normal nails. We also examined the relationship between a number of health and behavioral variables and brittle nails. In all, 102 participants with either brittle or normal nails had two nails clipped and then analyzed for water content by a blinded investigator in the laboratory. Participants filled out a detailed questionnaire designed to reveal information about health and behavior. The mean water content for normal nails was 11.90% and for brittle nails was 12.48%. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. The odds of having brittle nails was 3.23 times greater among participants who received a professional manicure (95% confidence interval 1.21, 8.59). The frequency of professional manicures was associated with the likelihood of having brittle nails. Frequency of hand moisturizer use was significantly associated with nail brittleness (95% confidence interval 1.35, 32.10). Family history was significantly associated with the likelihood of having brittle nails (95% confidence interval 1.65, 21.11). Analyzing nails from living participants is limiting because samples can only be collected from the distal unattached nail plate. A small subanalysis was performed and showed that the nails were losing water between the time of clipping and laboratory analysis. Therefore, our water percentage results may not be representative of in vivo nail plate water contents. There was no significant difference in water content of brittle compared with normal nails.

Association of SPINK5 gene polymorphisms with atopic dermatitis in Northeast China.
Background? Defect in the SPINK5 gene is known to be implicated in Netherton syndrome (NS), and has been suggested to be a locus predisposing to atopy in general. Coding polymorphisms in SPINK5 exons 13, 14 and 26 have been reported to be associated with atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma and high level of IgE. Objectives? To examine whether the SPINK5 gene polymorphisms are associated with AD in Northeast China, and to assess how variants influence selected phenotypic traits. Methods? A case-control study was conducted on four non-synonymous polymorphisms in the coding region of SPINK5 in AD and controls. The SPINK5 gene polymorphisms were analyzed using the PCR and RFLP methods. Results? For the four non-synonymous SNPs, A1103G(Asn368Ser), G1156A(Asp386Asn), G1258A(Glu420Lys), G2475T(Glu825Asp) in SPINK5, the allelic frequencies in the AD cohort were 0.55 for 1103G, 0.57 for 1156A, 0.54for 1258A, 0.62 for 2475T, consistent with those already published in the original British and Japanese cohorts. The T allele of SNP 2475G?>?T was found to be significantly associated with AD. There were significant differences in genotype frequencies for G1258A(Glu420Lys) and G2475T(Glu825Asp) but not for A1103G(Asn368Ser) and G1156A(Asp386Asn). Genotypes GA(420Glu/Lys), TT (2475Asp/Asp) and GT(2475Glu/Asp) were significantly more frequent in AD. However, the SPINK5 gene polymorphisms was found not to be associated with AD in regard to either serum IgE levels, concurrent allergic asthma or early onset of AD. Conclusions? Our study confirms the association between SPINK5 and AD.

Synergistic damage by UVA radiation and pollutants.
Not only is skin cancer by far the most common human cancer but also the incidence of skin cancer has been increasing at an alarming rate in recent decades. Fortunately, most people now realize that sun exposure causes unattractive photoaging and skin cancer, so they do apply sunscreens conscientiously. However, until recently, most sunscreens did not adequately protect against ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation. Although UVA is indeed less erythrogenic and less carcinogenic than UVB, UVA directly causes photoaging and enhances UVB-induced skin cancer. Furthermore, recent research demonstrates that UVA combined with environmental pollutants (including cigarette smoke) significantly increases the risk of skin cancer. Similarly, previous research demonstrated another synergy between environmental pollutants and UV: When ozone exposure precedes UV exposure, there is enhancement of UV-induced depletion of protective vitamin E from the skin's stratum corneum. This article reviews experimental evidence that environmental pollutants (such as benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a commonly used index of environmental pollution) are photosensitizers that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) when exposed to UVA radiation. This in turn causes oxidative and genetic damage, leading to unattractive photodamage and carcinogenesis.
