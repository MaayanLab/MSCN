Effect of flunarizine, a calcium channel blocker, on intraocular pressure and aqueous humor dynamics in monkeys.
To evaluate the effects of flunarizine, a nonselective calcium channel blocker, on intraocular pressure (IOP) in monkeys with laser-induced unilateral glaucoma and on aqueous humor dynamics in normal monkeys. The IOP was measured before and hourly for 6 hours after single-dose administration of 0.5%, 1%, or 2% flunarizine to the glaucomatous eye of 8 monkeys with unilateral laser-induced glaucoma. In a separate multiple-dose study, 0.5% flunarizine was applied twice daily for 5 consecutive days to the glaucomatous eye of the same 8 monkeys. IOP was measured at untreated baseline, after treatment with vehicle only, and on treatment days 1, 3, and 5. Tonographic outflow facility and fluorophotometric flow rates of aqueous humor were measured in 7 normal monkeys before and after the fifth dose of twice-daily treatment with 0.5% flunarizine. Unilateral application of 50 microL of 0.5%, 1%, or 2% flunarizine reduced IOP bilaterally. In the treated glaucomatous eyes, flunarizine reduced the IOP for 2, 3, or 5 hours, with a maximum reduction of 2.5+/-0.5 (mean+/-SEM) mm Hg (9%), 3.0+/-0.4 mm Hg (10%), and 5.0+/-0.8 mm Hg (18%) following the 0.5%, 1%, and 2% concentrations, respectively (P<0.01). The maximum reductions in IOP in the contralateral untreated eyes were 1.3+/-0.5 mm Hg, 1.5+/-0.3 mm Hg, and 2.9+/-0.7 mm Hg following the 0.5%, 1%, and 2% concentrations, respectively (P<0.05). Both the magnitude and duration of the ocular hypotensive effect of 0.5% flunarizine were enhanced with twice-daily administration for 5 days. Outflow facility in normal monkey eyes was increased (P<0.05) by 39% in the treated eyes compared with vehicle-treated contralateral eyes and by 41% compared with baseline values, and aqueous humor flow rates were unchanged (P>0.30). Flunarizine reduces IOP in a dose-dependent manner when administered to glaucomatous monkey eyes, but also has an ocular hypotensive effect on the contralateral untreated eyes. An increase in tonographic outflow facility seems to account for the IOP reduction in normal monkey eyes.

Effect of 15-keto latanoprost on intraocular pressure and aqueous humor dynamics in monkey eyes.
To compare the ocular hypotensive effects of 15-keto latanoprost (KL) with the commercial preparation of latanoprost (Xalatan; Pfizer, New York, NY) in monkey eyes with laser-induced unilateral glaucoma and to evaluate the effects of topical 0.005% KL on aqueous humor dynamics in normal monkey eyes. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured hourly for 6 hours beginning at 9:30 AM on day 1 (untreated baseline); day 2 (vehicle only); and treatment days 1, 3, and 5 (topical, 30 microL of study drug) in the glaucomatous eyes of four to eight monkeys with unilateral laser-induced glaucoma. KL concentrations of 0.0001%, 0.001%, and 0.01% and latanoprost at 0.005% were studied separately, with a minimum washout period of 2 weeks between studies. Tonographic outflow facility (C) and fluorophotometric aqueous humor flow rates (F) were measured in nine normal monkeys before and after a single topical dose of 0.005% KL in one eye, with a vehicle-only control in the fellow eye. When applied once daily to glaucomatous monkey eyes, all three concentrations of KL and a 0.005% concentration of latanoprost produced significant (P < 0.05) reductions in IOP, with the maximum reduction on treatment day 5, regardless of the drug or concentration studied. The maximum reduction (P < 0.001) from vehicle-only baseline IOP was (mean +/- SEM) 3.0 +/- 0.3 mm Hg (9%) for 0.0001% KL, 7.6 +/- 0.6 mm Hg (23%) for 0.001% KL, 6.3 +/- 0.4 mm Hg (18%) for 0.01% KL, and 6.6 +/- 0.6 mm Hg (20%) for 0.005% latanoprost. After application of a single dose of 0.005% KL in nine normal monkey eyes, neither C nor F was altered (P > 0.80) when compared with untreated baseline values or vehicle-treated control eyes. The reduction in IOP produced by 0.001% KL was equivalent to, and at some measured time points, greater than the effect produced by 0.005% latanoprost. The IOP reduction by KL in normal monkeys appeared to have no effect on aqueous humor production or tonographic outflow facility and may thus indicate a drug-induced increase in uveoscleral outflow.
