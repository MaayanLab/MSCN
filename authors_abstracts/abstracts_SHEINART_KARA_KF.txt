Spontaneous caudate hemorrhage associated with ingestion of a decongestant containing phenylpropanolamine.
Intracerebral hemorrhage has been associated with phenylpropanolamine, a sympathomimetic agent contained in many over-the-counter medications. Caudate hemorrhage is infrequent, usually related to hypertension, and has not been reported following ingestion of medications containing phenylpropanolamine. We report an unusual case of caudate hemorrhage which developed in a patient taking an over-the-counter nasal decongestant containing phenylpropanolamine.
