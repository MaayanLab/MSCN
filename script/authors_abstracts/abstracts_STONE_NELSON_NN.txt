Influence of pretreatment and treatment factors on intermediate to long-term outcome after prostate brachytherapy.
We describe how treatment factors influence biochemical freedom from failure, local control, freedom from metastasis and cause specific survival in patients treated with prostate brachytherapy. We followed 2,111 men who underwent brachytherapy a median of 6 years (range 2 to 17). Median prostate specific antigen was 7 ng/ml. Of the men 1,455 (68.9%) had clinical stage T2a or less and 1,428 (67.6%) had Gleason score less than 7. A total of 1,171 patients (55.5%) received (125)I, 221 (10.4%) received (103)Pd and 719 (34.1%) received supplemental external beam irradiation combined with (103)Pd. Post-implant dosimetry was done 30 days after implantation with doses converted to the biologically effective dose. Prostate biopsy was done 2 years after permanent prostate brachytherapy in 586 men (27.8%). Survival functions were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression with proportions tested by the log rank test. The 12-year biochemical freedom from failure rate was 78.6%, and stage, Gleason score, prostate specific antigen and biologically effective dose were significant predictors (p = 0.007, <0.001, 0.005 and <0.001, respectively). In 964 patients at low risk the biochemical freedom from failure rate was 88.1% and significant predictors were hormonal therapy (p = 0.030), prostate specific antigen (p = 0.026) and biologically effective dose (p = 0.003). In 499 patients at intermediate risk the biochemical freedom from failure rate was 79.2% with biologically effective dose a significant predictor (p <0.001). In 648 men at high risk the biochemical freedom from failure rate was 67% and significant predictors were hormonal therapy, Gleason score and biologically effective dose (p = 0.036, <0.001 and 0.012, respectively). The local failure rate was 7.3% with biologically effective dose a significant predictor (p <0.001). Prostate biopsy was positive in 21 of 121 cases (21.5%) for a biologically effective dose of 150 Gy2 or less, in 14 of 248 (5.6%) for greater than 150 to 200 Gy2 and in 3 of 193 (1.6%) for greater than 200 Gy2 (p <0.001). The 12-year freedom from metastasis rate was 95.2% with Gleason score a significant predictor (p <0.001). Cause specific survival at 12 years was 94.5% with Gleason score and biologically effective dose significant predictors (p <0.001 and 0.027, respectively). Permanent prostate brachytherapy yields excellent long-term oncologic outcomes. High biologically effective dose may need to be delivered to achieve successful biochemical freedom from failure, local control and cause specific survival.

Outcomes for patients with extraprostatic prostate cancer treated with trimodality therapy, including brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy, and hormone therapy.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of multimodality therapy consisting of hormone therapy (HT), brachytherapy (BT), and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in extraprostatic prostate cancer and identify factors with predictive value. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 1992 and October 2006, 97 patients with extraprostatic prostate cancer received permanent seed implant BT. Extraprostatic disease was defined by one or more of the following: positive seminal vesicle biopsy (n=56), positive lymph node dissection (n=8), or a clinical tumor stage of T3 (n=48). Treatment consisted of BT alone with (103)Pd or (125)I (n=4); HT and BT (n=3); BT and EBRT (n=2); or trimodality therapy with HT, BT, and EBRT (n=88). Median followup was 69 (range, 23-182) months. Freedom from biochemical failure (FBF) rates were calculated using the Phoenix criteria. RESULTS: The 7-year actuarial FBF, freedom from distant metastases, disease-specific survival, and overall survival rates were 67%, 82%, 96%, and 81%, respectively. Biologically effective dose (BED) was the only variable significantly impacting FBF rates. FBF at 7 years was 60% vs. 74% for BED below 200 and 200 or above, respectively (p=0.048). Trends toward worse outcomes were noted with increasing Gleason score, with 7-year FBF rates of 86% vs. 71% vs. 55% for scores of 6 or less, 7, and 8-10, respectively (p=0.090). BED was the only significant predictor of FBF in multivariate analysis (p=0.032). None of the predictors were significant in multivariable analyses for the other outcomes studied. CONCLUSIONS: Trimodality approach achieves durable biochemical control in most patients with historically poor prognosis T3 prostate cancer. BED above 200Gy was associated with superior FBF.

Long-term outcome and toxicity of salvage brachytherapy for local failure after initial radiotherapy for prostate cancer.
To describe long-term outcomes and toxicity after salvage brachytherapy (BT) for local failure after initial radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Between 1994 and 2008, 37 men with local failure after initial prostate radiotherapy (32 external-beam radiation therapy [EBRT] and 5 BT) underwent salvage BT with (103)Pd or (125)I. Estimates of freedom from biochemical failure (FFbF, Phoenix definition) and cause-specific survival (CSS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicities were graded using CTCv3.0. Median follow-up was 86 months (range, 2-156). The median dose to 90% of the prostate volume was 122 Gy (range, 67-166). The 10-year FFbF and CSS were 54% and 96%, respectively. On univariate analysis, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >10 ng/mL at initial diagnosis was significantly associated with FFbF (p = 0.01), and there were trends for both age <70 years (p = 0.08) and PSA <6 ng/mL (p = 0.08) at the time of salvage BT. On multivariate analysis, only presalvage PSA <6 ng/mL (p = 0.046) was significantly associated with improved FFbF. There were three Grade 3 toxicities and one Grade 4 toxicity. Pelvic lymph node dissection before salvage BT was the only variable significantly associated with Grade > or = 2 toxicity (p = 0.03). With a median follow-up of 86 months, salvage prostate BT was associated with a 10-year FFbF of 54% and CSS of 96%. Improved FFbF was associated with a presalvage PSA <6 ng/mL. Toxicity was worse in patients who had undergone pelvic lymph node dissection before salvage BT. Careful patient selection for salvage BT may result in improved outcomes and reduced toxicity.

Young men have equivalent biochemical outcomes compared with older men after treatment with brachytherapy for prostate cancer.
To evaluate retrospectively the biochemical outcomes of young men treated with low-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer. From 1990 to 2005, 1,665 men with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated with low-dose-rate brachytherapy +/- hormone therapy (HT) +/- external beam radiotherapy and underwent > or = 2 years of follow-up. Patients were stratified on the basis of age: < or = 60 (n = 378) and >60 years (n = 1,287). Biochemical failure was defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir plus 2 ng/mL. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the association of variables with freedom from biochemical failure (FFbF). Median follow-up was 68 months (range, 24-180) for men < or = 60 years and 66 months (range, 24-200) for men >60. For the entire group, the actuarial 5- and 8-year FFbF rates were 94% and 88%, respectively. Men < or = 60 demonstrated similar 5- and 8-year FFbF (95% and 92%) compared with men >60 (93% and 87%; p = 0.071). A larger percent of young patients presented with low-risk disease; lower clinical stage, Gleason score (GS), and pretreatment PSA values; were treated after 1997; did not receive any HT; and had a high biologic effective dose (BED) of radiation (all ps <0.001). On multivariate analysis, PSA (p = 0.001), GS (p = 0.005), and BED (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with FFbF, but age was not (p = 0.665). Young men achieve excellent 5- and 8-year biochemical control rates that are comparable to those of older men after prostate brachytherapy. Young age should not be a deterrent when considering brachytherapy as a primary treatment option for clinically localized prostate cancer.

Does neoadjuvant hormonal therapy improve urinary function when given to men with large prostates undergoing prostate brachytherapy?
We evaluated the effect of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy on urinary function in men with a prostate volume of 50 cc or greater undergoing prostate brachytherapy. A total of 395 men with 50 cc or greater glands were treated with 3 months of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (204) or implantation alone (191). Urinary function was assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score, the urinary retention incidence and subsequent transurethral prostate resection. Median patient age was 67 years and median followup was 6 years. Mean prostate volume in neoadjuvant hormonal therapy cases was 72.9 cc, which decreased to 54.3 cc after 3 months (p <0.001). Mean prostate volume in cases without hormonal therapy was 60.6 cc (p <0.001). Urinary retention occurred in 16 of 191 men (8.4%) without vs 25 of 204 (12.3%) with hormonal therapy (p = 0.207). The median duration of urinary retention was 42 days (range 2 to 243). There were no significant associations of urinary retention with prostate size, prostate or urethral dose, or pre-implantation International Prostate Symptom Score. Of patients without hormonal therapy retention occurred in 3 of 12 (25%) with a pre-implantation International Prostate Symptom Score of 15 or greater and in 13 of 168 (7.7%) with a score of less than 15 (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1-16, p = 0.04). In contrast, there was no difference in the retention rate in patients with hormonal therapy with an initial score of 15 or greater vs less than 15 (2 of 25 or 8% vs 11 of 102 or 10.8%, p = 0.614). Transurethral prostate resection was done in 11 of 191 men (5.8%) without vs 12 of 204 (5.9%) with hormonal therapy (p = 0.958). There was no difference in biochemical failure in the 2 groups. Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy has its greatest benefit in patients receiving brachytherapy who have a large prostate and an International Prostate Symptom Score of 15 or greater.

Impact of hormonal therapy on intermediate risk prostate cancer treated with combination brachytherapy and external beam irradiation.
We assessed the impact of androgen suppressive therapy on biochemical failure in patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy and external beam irradiation. From 1994 to 2006, 432 patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer as defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network were treated with low dose rate brachytherapy and external beam irradiation with or without 9 months of androgen suppressive therapy. Gleason score was 7 in 76% of cases and prostate specific antigen was 1.4 to 20 ng/ml (median 7.6). Of the patients 350 received androgen suppressive therapy and 82 did not. The biologically effective dose was 142 to 280 Gy2 (median 206). Followup was 23 to 155 months (median 56). The overall 8-year biochemical failure-free rate using the Phoenix definition in patients with vs without androgen suppressive therapy was 92% vs 92% (p = 0.4). The therapy had no significant impact on the biochemical failure-free rate in patients with Gleason score 7 (92% vs 90.5%, p = 0.55), prostate specific antigen 10 to 20 ng/ml (92% vs 100%, p = 0.32), T2b-T2c disease (89.5% vs 97%, p = 0.27) and more than 1 intermediate risk feature (90% vs 100%, p = 0.2). We addressed the relative importance of radiation dose vs hormonal therapy for intermediate risk prostate cancer. With high biologically effective dose combination treatment androgen suppressive therapy did not have a significant impact on the 8-year biochemical failure-free rate. We question its routine use in this setting.

Do high radiation doses in locally advanced prostate cancer patients treated with 103Pd implant plus external beam irradiation cause increased urinary, rectal, and sexual morbidity?
To investigate the morbidity of higher radiation doses in prostate cancer patients. Five hundred eighty-five men treated with seed implantation and external beam irradiation were followed a median of 5 years (range, 2-11). Hormonal therapy (HT) of 9 months duration was used in 504 (86.2%) patients. The biologic effective dose (BED) was calculated using an alpha/beta of 2. Urinary incontinence (UI) and symptoms (IPSS) were prospectively collected. Rectal morbidity was scored according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scale. Two BED dose groups of <or=220 Gy (n=449) and >220 Gy (n=136) were used. Comparisons of means were made by Student's t test, and the associations were tested by chi-square analysis (Pearson). Urinary retention developed in 36 (6.2%) and was not associated with BED or IPSS. Retention occurred more often with prostate volume >50 cc (17%, p=0.001). The median change in urinary symptoms (IPSS) was 1. Sixty-one percent with high BED were more likely to have increased postimplant symptoms compared with 39% with lower BED (p=0.025; odds ratio [OR], 1.107; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.21). UI occurred in 25 patients (4.3%) and was only associated with a postimplant transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) (n=25), 16% vs. 2.3% for no TURP (p=0.001; OR, 8; 95% CI, 2.4-27). Of the 373 patients initially potent, 204 (54.7%) maintained potency. Impotence was only associated with age at implant (p=0.001) and HT (p=0.004). Sixty-two (10.6%) patients had Grade 1-2 and 4 patients had Grade 3-4 (0.7%, 2 ulcers and 2 fistulas) rectal complications. Three of the Grade 3/4 complications occurred with a dose <or=220 Gy. A BED >220 Gy does not seem to increase morbidity.

Local control following permanent prostate brachytherapy: effect of high biologically effective dose on biopsy results and oncologic outcomes.
To determine factors that influence local control and systemic relapse in patients undergoing permanent prostate brachytherapy (PPB). A total of 584 patients receiving PPB alone or PPB with external beam radiation therapy (19.5%) agreed to undergo prostate biopsy (PB) at 2 years postimplantion and yearly if results were positive or if the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level increased. Short-term hormone therapy was used with 280 (47.9%) patients. Radiation doses were converted to biologically effective doses (BED) (using alpha/beta = 2). Comparisons were made by chi-square analysis and linear regression. Survival was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. The median PSA concentration was 7.1 ng/ml, and the median follow-up period was 7.1 years. PB results were positive for 48/584 (8.2%) patients. Positive biopsy results by BED group were as follows: 22/121 (18.2%) patients received a BED of < or =150 Gy; 15/244 (6.1%) patients received >150 to 200 Gy; and 6/193 (3.1%; p < 0.001) patients received >200 Gy. Significant associations of positive PB results by risk group were low-risk group BED (p = 0.019), intermediate-risk group hormone therapy (p = 0.011) and BED (p = 0.040), and high-risk group BED (p = 0.004). Biochemical freedom from failure rate at 7 years was 82.7%. Biochemical freedom from failure rate by PB result was 84.7% for negative results vs. 59.2% for positive results (p < 0.001). Cox regression analysis revealed significant associations with BED (p = 0.038) and PB results (p = 0.002) in low-risk patients, with BED (p = 0.003) in intermediate-risk patients, and with Gleason score (p = 0.006), PSA level (p < 0.001), and PB result (p = 0.038) in high-risk patients. Fifty-three (9.1%) patients died, of which eight deaths were due to prostate cancer. Cause-specific survival was 99.2% for negative PB results vs. 87.6% for positive PB results (p < 0.001). Higher radiation doses are required to achieve local control following PPB. A BED of >200 Gy with an alpha/beta ratio of 2 yields 96.9% local control rate. Failure to establish local control impacts survival.

Outcomes for patients with high-grade prostate cancer treated with a combination of brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy and hormonal therapy.
To assess the outcomes for patients with Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and hormonal therapy (HT). In all, 181 patients with Gleason scores 8-10 prostate cancer were treated from 1994 to 2006 with a (103)Pd implant (prescription dose 100 Gy), 45 Gy of EBRT and 9 months of HT. The median (range) follow-up was 65 (24-150) months; freedom from biochemical failure (FBF) rates were calculated using the Phoenix definition. The 8-year actuarial FBF, freedom from distant metastases, prostate-cancer specific survival and overall survival were 73%, 80%, 87% and 79%, respectively. The pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level significantly affected FBF, with 8-year rates of 72%, 82% and 58% for patients with PSA level of <or=10, >10-20 and >20 ng/mL, respectively (P = 0.006). The PSA level had no significant effect on rates of distant metastases. The Gleason score had the most significant affect on FBF in a multivariate analysis, and was the only factor to significantly affect rates of distant metastases; the 8-year FBF rates were 84%, 55% and 30% for scores of 8, 9 and 10, respectively (P = 0.003). The corresponding freedom from distant metastases and prostate-cancer specific survival rates were 86%, 76%, 30% (P < 0.001) and 92%, 80%, 62.5% (P = 0.003), respectively. The 8-year outcomes after this regimen showed favourable biochemical and distant control, as well disease-specific survival rates for patients with Gleason scores of 8-10. This treatment approach should be considered as a viable option for this subset of patients with high-risk disease.

There is no correlation between erectile dysfunction and dose to penile bulb and neurovascular bundles following real-time low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.
We evaluated the relationship between the onset of erectile dysfunction and dose to the penile bulb and neurovascular bundles (NVBs) after real-time ultrasound-guided prostate brachytherapy. One hundred forty-seven patients who underwent prostate brachytherapy met the following eligibility criteria: (1) treatment with 125I brachytherapy to a prescribed dose of 160 Gy with or without hormones without supplemental external beam radiation therapy, (2) identification as potent before the time of implantation based on a score of 2 or higher on the physician-assigned Mount Sinai Erectile Function Score and a score of 16 or higher on the abbreviated International Index of Erectile Function patient assessment, and (3) minimum follow-up of 12 months. Median follow-up was 25.7 months (range, 12-47 months). The 3-year actuarial rate of impotence was 23% (34 of 147 patients). An additional 43% of potent patients (49 of 113 patients) were using a potency aid at last follow-up. The penile bulb volume receiving 100% of the prescription dose (V(100)) ranged from 0-0.05 cc (median, 0 cc), with a dose to the hottest 5% (D(5)) range of 12.5-97.9 Gy (median, 40.8 Gy). There was no correlation between penile bulb D(5) or V(100) and postimplantation impotency on actuarial analysis. For the combined right and left NVB structures, V(100) range was 0.3-5.1 cc (median, 1.8 cc), and V(150) range was 0-1.5 cc (median, 0.31 cc). There was no association between NVB V(100) or V(150) and postimplantation impotency on actuarial analysis. Penile bulb doses are low after real-time ultrasound-guided prostate brachytherapy. We found no correlation between dose to either the penile bulb or NVBs and the development of postimplantation impotency.

Effect of family history on outcomes in patients treated with definitive brachytherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer.
To determine the impact familial prostate cancer has on prognosis in men treated with brachytherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer. A total of 1,738 consecutive patients with prostate cancer (cT1-3, N0/X, M0) received low-dose-rate brachytherapy alone or in combination with external beam radiation therapy or hormone ablation from 1992 to 2005. The primary end-point was freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) using the Phoenix definition. Minimum follow-up was 2 years and the median follow-up was 60 months (range, 24-197 months). A total of 187 of 1,738 men (11%) had a family history of prostate cancer in a first-degree relative. For the low-risk patients, both groups had similar actuarial 5-year FFBF (97.2% vs. 95.5%, p = 0.516). For intermediate-risk patients, there was a trend toward improved biochemical control in men positive for family history (5-yr FFBF 100% vs. 93.6%, p = 0.076). For the high-risk patients, men with a positive family history had similar 5-year FFBF (92.8% vs. 85.2%, p = 0.124). On multivariate analysis, family history was not significant; use of hormones, high biologic effective dose, initial prostate-specific antigen value, and Gleason score were the significant variables predicting biochemical control. This is the first study to examine the relationship of familial prostate cancer and outcomed in men treated with brachytherapy alone or in combination therapy. Men with a positive family history have clinicopathologic characteristics and biochemical outcomes similar to those with sporadic disease.

Distant and local recurrence in patients with biochemical failure after prostate brachytherapy.
To analyze the patterns of failure after the brachytherapy management of localized prostate cancer. From 1990 to 2008, 2869 patients underwent prostate brachytherapy and 213 experienced a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure by the Phoenix definition. Of these 213 patients, 33.5% were low, 18.5% intermediate, and 58% high risk. Of the 119 patients biopsied, 36 (30%) had a least one positive posttreatment biopsy. In univariate and multivariate analyses, PSA doubling time was the most predictive of a positive biopsy. Patients with doubling times < or =3, >3-6, > or =6-10, and >10 months had positive biopsy rates of 9%, 18%, 36%, and 42%, respectively (p=0.01). The actuarial rate of remaining free from distant metastases at 10 years was 73%. Patients with PSA doubling times of < or =3, >3-6, >6-10, and >10 months had freedom from distant metastases rates of 0%, 74%, 78%, and 94.5% at 10 years, respectively (p<0.0001). In multivariate analysis, PSA doubling time and time to PSA failure were the most significant predictors of developing distant metastases. About one third of patients harbor a component of local failure and one fourth demonstrate clinical metastases. PSA doubling time can be used to help predict the source of a rising PSA.

Multicenter analysis of effect of high biologic effective dose on biochemical failure and survival outcomes in patients with Gleason score 7-10 prostate cancer treated with permanent prostate brachytherapy.
To investigate the biochemical control rates and survival for Gleason score 7-10 prostate cancer patients undergoing permanent prostate brachytherapy as a function of the biologic effective dose (BED). Six centers provided data on 5,889 permanent prostate brachytherapy patients, of whom 1,078 had Gleason score 7 (n = 845) or Gleason score 8-10 (n = 233) prostate cancer and postimplant dosimetry results available. The median prostate-specific antigen level was 7.5 ng/mL (range, 0.4-300). The median follow-up for censored patients was 46 months (range, 5-130). Short-term hormonal therapy (median duration, 3.9 months) was used in 666 patients (61.8%) and supplemental external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in 620 (57.5%). The patients were stratified into three BED groups: <200 Gy (n = 645), 200-220 Gy (n = 199), and >220 Gy (n = 234). Biochemical freedom from failure (bFFF) was determined using the Phoenix definition. The 5-year bFFF rate was 80%. The bFFF rate stratified by the three BED groups was 76.4%, 83.5%, and 88.3% (p < 0.001), respectively. Cox regression analysis revealed Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level, use of hormonal therapy, EBRT, and BED were associated with bFFF (p < 0.001). Freedom from metastasis improved from 92% to 99% with the greatest doses. The overall survival rate at 5 years for the three BED groups for Gleason score 8-10 cancer was 86.6%, 89.4%, and 94.6%, respectively (p = 0.048). These data suggest that permanent prostate brachytherapy combined with EBRT and hormonal therapy yields excellent bFFF and survival results in Gleason score 7-10 patients when the delivered BEDs are >220 Gy. These doses can be achieved by a combination of 45-Gy EBRT with a minimal dose received by 90% of the target volume of 120 Gy of (103)Pd or 130 Gy of (125)I.

Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in SOD2, XRCC1 and XRCC3 with susceptibility for the development of adverse effects resulting from radiotherapy for prostate cancer.
The objective of this study was to determine whether an association exists between certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which have previously been linked with adverse normal tissue effects resulting from radiotherapy, and the development of radiation injury resulting from radiotherapy for prostate cancer. A total of 135 consecutive patients with clinically localized prostate cancer and a minimum of 1 year of follow-up who had been treated with radiation therapy, either brachytherapy alone or in combination with external-beam radiotherapy, with or without hormone therapy, were genotyped for SNPs in SOD2, XRCC1 and XRCC3. Three common late tissue toxicities were investigated: late rectal bleeding, urinary morbidity, and erectile dysfunction. Patients with the XRCC1 rs25489 G/A (Arg280His) genotype were more likely to develop erectile dysfunction after irradiation than patients who had the G/G genotype (67% compared to 24%; P=0.048). In addition, patients who had the SOD2 rs4880 T/C (Val16Ala) genotype exhibited a significant increase in grade 2 late rectal bleeding compared to patients who had either the C/C or T/T genotype for this SNP (8% compared to 0%; P=0.02). Finally, patients with the combination of the SOD2 rs4880 C/T genotype and XRCC3 rs861539 T/C (Thr241Met) genotype experienced a significant increase in grade 2 late rectal bleeding compared to patients without this particular genotypic arrangement (14% compared to 1%; P=0.002). These results suggest that SNPs in the SOD2, XRCC1 and XRCC3 genes are associated with the development of late radiation injury in patients treated with radiation therapy for prostate adenocarcinoma.

(125)I monotherapy using D90 implant doses of 180 Gy or greater.
The purpose of this study was to characterize the oncologic results and toxicity profile of patients treated with (125)I implants using the dose delivered to 90% of the gland from the dose-volume histogram (D90) of greater than 144 Gy. From June 1995 to Feb 2005, a total of 643 patients were treated with (125)I monotherapy for T1-T2 prostate cancer with a D90 of 180 Gy or greater (median, 197 Gy; range, 180-267 Gy). Implantations were performed using a real-time ultrasound-guided seed-placement method and intraoperative dosimetry to optimize target coverage and homogeneity by using modified peripheral loading. We analyzed biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) of 435 patients who had a minimum 2-year prostate-specific antigen follow-up (median follow-up, 6.7 years; range, 2.0-11.1 years). Five-year bDFS rates for the entire cohort using the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology and Phoenix definitions were 96.9% and 96.5%, respectively. Using the Phoenix definition, 5-year bDFS rates were 97.3% for low-risk patients and 92.8% for intermediate/high-risk patients. The positive biopsy rate was 4.1%. The freedom rate from Grade 2 or higher rectal bleeding at 5 years was 88.5%. Acute urinary retention occurred in 10.7%, more commonly in patients with high pretreatment International Prostate Symptom Scores (p < 0.01). In patients who were potent before treatment, 73.4% remained potent at 5 years after implantation. Patients with a minimum D90 of 180 Gy had outstanding local control based on prostate-specific antigen control and biopsy data. Toxicity profiles, particularly for long-term urinary and sexual function, were excellent and showed that D90 doses of 180 Gy or greater performed using the technique described were feasible and tolerable.

Brachytherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.
Low-dose rate brachytherapy has become a mainstream treatment option for men diagnosed with prostate cancer because of excellent long-term treatment outcomes in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients. Largely due to patient lead advocacy for minimally invasive treatment options, high-quality prostate implants have become widely available in the US, Europe, and Japan. The reason that brachytherapy results are reproducible in several different practice settings is because numerous implant quality factors have been defined over the last 20 years, which can be applied objectively to judge the success of the intervention both during and after the procedure. In addition, recent long-term follow-up studies have clarified that the secondary cancer incidence of brachytherapy is not clinically meaningful. In terms of future directions, the study of radiation repair genetics may allow for the counseling physician to better estimate any given patients risk for side effects, thereby substantially reducing the therapeutic uncertainties faced by patients choosing a prostate cancer intervention.

TGFB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with adverse quality of life in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.
To investigate whether the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within TGFB1 might be predictive for the development of adverse quality-of-life outcomes in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. A total of 141 prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy were screened for SNPs in TGFB1 using DNA sequencing. Three quality-of-life outcomes were investigated: (1) prospective decline in erectile function, (2) urinary quality of life, and (3) rectal bleeding. Median follow-up was 51.3 months (range, 12-138 months; SD, 24.4 months). Those patients who possessed either the T/T genotype at position -509, the C/C genotype at position 869 (pro/pro, codon 10) or the G/C genotype at position 915 (arg/pro, codon 25) were significantly associated with the development of a decline in erectile function compared with those who did not have these genotypes: 56% (9 of 16) vs. 24% (11 of 45) (p = 0.02). In addition, patients with the -509 T/T genotype had a significantly increased risk of developing late rectal bleeding compared with those who had either the C/T or C/C genotype at this position: 55% (6 of 11) vs. 26% (34 of 130) (p = 0.05). Possession of certain TGFB1 genotypes is associated with the development of both erectile dysfunction and late rectal bleeding in patients treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Therefore, identification of patients harboring these genotypes may represent a means to predict which men are most likely to suffer from poor quality-of-life outcomes after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.

Customized dose prescription for permanent prostate brachytherapy: insights from a multicenter analysis of dosimetry outcomes.
To investigate the biochemical control rate in patients undergoing permanent prostate brachytherapy as a function of the biologically effective dose (BED) and risk group. Six centers provided data on 3,928 permanent brachytherapy patients with postimplant dosimetry results. The mean prostate-specific antigen level was 8.9 ng/mL. (125)I was used in 2,293 (58%), (103)Pd in 1,635, and supplemental external beam radiotherapy in 882 (22.5%) patients. The patients were stratified into low- (n = 2,188), intermediate- (n = 1,188), and high- (n = 552) risk groups and into three BED groups of < 140 Gy (n = 524), 140-200 Gy (n = 2284), and >200 Gy (n = 1,115). Freedom from biochemical disease progression (biochemical freedom from failure [bFFF]) was determined using the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology Oncology and Phoenix definitions and calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with factors compared using the log-rank test. The 10-year prostate-specific antigen bFFF rate for the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology Oncology and Phoenix definitions was 79.2% and 70%, respectively. The corresponding bFFF rates for the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups was 84.1% and 78.1%, 76.8% and 63.6%, and 64.4% and 58.2%, respectively (p < 0.0001). The corresponding bFFF rate for the three BED groups was 56.1% and 41.4%, 80% and 77.9%, and 91.1% and 82.9% (p < 0.0001). The corresponding bFFF rate for the low-risk patients by dose group was 69.8% and 49.8%, 86% and 85.2%, and 88.1% and 88.3% for the low-, intermediate, and high-dose group, respectively (p <0.0001). The corresponding bFFF rate for the intermediate-risk patients by dose group was 52.9% and 23.1%, 74.1% and 77.7%, and 94.3% and 88.8% for the low-, intermediate-, and high-dose group, respectively (p < 0.0001). The corresponding bFFF rate for high-risk patients by dose group was 19.2% and 41.7%, 61.8% and 53.2%, and 90% and 69.6% for the low-, intermediate-, and high-dose group, respectively (p < 0.0001). These data suggest that permanent brachytherapy dose prescriptions can be customized to risk status. In low-risk patients, achieving a BED of >or=140 Gy might be adequate for prostate-specific antigen control. However, high-risk disease might require a BED dose of >or=200 Gy.

Effect of low dose-rate prostate brachytherapy on the sexual health of men with optimal sexual function before treatment: analysis at > or = 7 years of follow-up.
To evaluate the effect of low-dose rate prostate brachytherapy on the sexual health of men with > or = 7 years of prospective evaluation and optimum sexual function before treatment. In all, 223 patients with T1b to T3a prostate cancer and a median (range) age of 66 (50-82) years were treated with permanent seed implantation from November 1990 to March 1998. They were followed for a median (range) of 8.2 (7-14.1) years using prospective quality-of-life measures. Erectile function (EF) was assessed using a physician-assigned score and beginning in June 2000; the validated International Index of EF (IIEF-5) was used as a complementary method to quantify late EF. No adjustment was made to differentiate sexual function with or with no pharmacological intervention for EF. Pearson's chi-square test and Student's t-test were used to compare the groups. Of the 223 men, 131 (59%) had optimal EF before their brachytherapy; of these, 51 (40%) at the last follow-up evaluation were using either a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (44, 86%), yohimbine (two, 4%) or alprostadil (five, 10%). The age at implantation was highly predictive of current EF; 23 of 25 (92%) men aged 50-59 years had a current EF of > or = 2; those aged 60-69 and 70-78 years had an EF of > or =2 in 48/75 (64%) and 18/31 (58%) (P = 0.01). A current IIEF-5 score of > or = 16 also correlated highly with age at implant, i.e. 50-59, 16/25 (64%); 60-69, 20/75 (27%) and 70-78 years, 6/31 (19%) (P < 0.001). Patients aged <60 years and with optimal EF before low-dose rate prostate brachytherapy have a very high probability of long-term EF.

A genetically determined dose-volume histogram predicts for rectal bleeding among patients treated with prostate brachytherapy.
To examine whether possession of genetic alterations in the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia) gene is associated with rectal bleeding in a dose-dependent and volume-dependent manner. One hundred eight prostate cancer patients who underwent brachytherapy using either an (125)I implant, a (103)Pd implant, or the combination of external beam radiotherapy with a (103)Pd implant and had a minimum of 1 year follow-up were screened for DNA sequence variations in the 62 coding exons of the ATM gene using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. Rectal dose was reported as the volume (in cubic centimeters) of rectum receiving the brachytherapy prescription dose. The two-sided Fisher exact test was used to compare differences in proportions. A significant correlation between the presence of any ATM sequence alteration and Grade 1 to 2 proctitis was obtained when the radiation dose to rectal tissue was quantified. Rectal bleeding occurred in 4 of 13 patients (31%) with a variant versus 1 of 23 (4%) without a genetic alteration for patients who had <0.7 cm(3) of rectal tissue receiving the implant prescription dose (p = 0.05). Of patients in whom 0.7-1.4 cm(3) of the rectum received the implant prescription, 4 of 11 (36%) with an ATM alteration exhibited Grade 1 to 2 proctitis, whereas 1 of 21 (5%) without a variant (p = 0.04) developed this radiation-induced late effect. The possession of genetic variants in the ATM gene is associated with the development of radiation-induced proctitis after prostate cancer radiotherapy for patients who receive the full prescription dose to either a low or a moderate volume of rectal tissue.

Patterns of local failure following prostate brachytherapy.
We describe biopsy results in patients with prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy. A total of 1,562 men with localized prostate cancer were treated with permanent prostate brachytherapy, of whom 508 agreed to ultrasound guided biopsies 2 years after the completion of all therapy. Median followup was 6.7 years (range 2 to 14.6) and median prostate specific antigen was 7.4 ng/ml (range 0.3 to 300). Disease was categorized as Gleason score less than 7 in 74.8% of patients, stage T2a or less in 64.2%, low risk in 43.1%, intermediate risk in 24.2% and high risk in 32.7%. Of the 508 men 315 (62%) received (125)I, 110 (21.7%) received (103)Pd and 83 (16.3%) received (103)Pd and external beam radiotherapy. A total of 237 men (46.7%) received a short course of hormonal therapy (3 to 9 months). Subsequent biopsies were performed after 2 years if initial biopsy was positive or prostate specific antigen increased. Post-implantation dosimetry results were grouped into low, normal and high dose. Associations were tested by chi-square analysis. Survival functions were calculated with Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression. A total of 643 biopsies were performed in 508 men between 2 and 11 years after implantation. Of the 508 men 39 (7.7%) had a final positive biopsy. Positive biopsy was associated with high prostate specific antigen (p=0.035), stage (p=0.003), risk (p=0.024), no hormonal therapy (p=0.002) and low dose (p<0.0001). On multivariate analysis only dose and hormonal therapy were significant (p<0.0001 and p=0.004, respectively). Of the patients 80% were free of PSA failure at 10 years if final biopsy was negative compared to 27.3% with a positive biopsy (p<0.0001). Death from prostate cancer was associated with a positive biopsy (OR 18.5, 95% CI 2.3-143, p<0.0001). Of the 52 men with a positive biopsy at year 2, 23 (44.2%) had negative results on subsequent biopsy, while 10 of the 456 (2.2%) with negative 2-year biopsies showed positive results. Positive biopsy occurred in the prostate only in 31 of 39 men (79.5%), in the prostate and seminal vesicles in 3 (7.7%), and in the seminal vesicles only in 5 (12.8%). Patients undergoing prostate brachytherapy must receive an adequate radiation dose to eradicate local disease. Hormonal therapy may benefit local control in patients with intermediate to high risk disease. Extraprostatic biopsies should be performed in patients with local failure who are considering salvage therapy to rule out seminal vesicle involvement.

Long-term urinary, sexual, and rectal morbidity in patients treated with iodine-125 prostate brachytherapy followed up for a minimum of 5 years.
To define the long-term morbidity in patients with prostate cancer who underwent iodine-125 brachytherapy. A total of 325 men with localized prostate cancer treated with iodine-125 brachytherapy had a median follow-up of 7 years (range 5 to 15). The American Urological Association symptom score, erectile function status, rectal bleeding incidence, and presence of urinary incontinence were collected prospectively before implantation and every 6 months thereafter. Comparisons were made between the pretreatment and treatment-related factors and their associations with quality-of-life changes. Associations were tested using the Student t, chi-square, and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. The median prostate volume and maximal dose to 90% of the prostate was 36.6 cm3 and 167 Gy, respectively. Of the 325 men, 15.7% experienced prostate-specific antigen failure and 4% started androgen deprivation therapy. The mean total symptom and bother scores increased from baseline (P <0.001) to 6 months after implantation, steadily decreased, and were unchanged at the last follow-up visit (P = 0.6). There were no significant associations among patient age, race, hormonal therapy use, prostate size, radiation dose, and urinary morbidity. Incontinence occurred in 4 (1.2%) of the 325 patients at the last follow-up visit and was associated with transurethral resection of the prostate (odds ratio 8.8, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 62, P = 0.008). Before implantation, 77.2% were able to have an erection adequate for intercourse and 50.6% were able to at the last follow-up visit. A significant correlation was found between potency preservation and age (P <0.001). Rectal bleeding occurred in 78 men (24%) 1 to 3 years after implantation. Nine patients (2.8%) complained of minor bleeding beyond 5 years, which was associated with greater radiation doses (P = 0.023). The preservation of urinary, sexual, and rectal quality of life is excellent at long follow-up for patients implanted with iodine-125.

The effect of brachytherapy, external beam irradiation and hormonal therapy on prostate volume.
We describe the effects of prostate brachytherapy with or without hormonal therapy, or external beam irradiation on gland volume. A total of 600 men with localized prostate cancer underwent 125I (357), 103Pd (118) or partial 103Pd combined with external beam irradiation (125) brachytherapy. Of the 600 men 299 (49.8%) received 3 to 9 months of hormonal therapy, which was initiated 3 months before implantation. Hormonal therapy consisted of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist plus antiandrogen in 251, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist in 41 and flutamide plus finasteride in 7. Prostate volume measurements were made before the initiation of hormonal therapy, at implantation and yearly. Median followup was 5.2 years. Associations were tested by chi-square analysis. Means were compared by 1-way ANOVA and the Student t test. Median initial prostate volume was 38.5 cc (range 9.2 to 151.5). Pre-implantation hormonal therapy resulted in a median prostate volume decrease of 33.1%. The mean reduction for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist was 27.6%, for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist plus antiandrogen it was 32.8% and for flutamide plus finasteride it was 10.8% (p=0.003). Prostate volume decreased 36.6% by year 1, 42.4% by year 4, 45.6% by year 6 and 51.2% by year 8 (p<0.0001). There was no difference in prostate volume reduction at year 1 between men receiving hormonal therapy vs implantation alone. Patients treated with 103Pd had a greater prostate volume reduction at 1 year than those who received 125I (p=0.004). Conversely patients treated with hormonal therapy and 125I had a smaller prostate volume reduction than those implanted with 125I alone (p=0.023). After year 1 there were no longer differences between any groups. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist plus antiandrogen is more successful for reducing prostate volume before prostate brachytherapy than luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist or flutamide plus finasteride. Hormonal therapy offered no advantage over implantation alone for post-implantation prostate volume reduction. 103Pd appears to reduce prostate volume more rapidly than 125I but this advantage is lost by year 2. No rebound in prostate volume was noted at longer followup.

Is seminal vesicle implantation with permanent sources possible? A dose-volume histogram analysis in patients undergoing combined 103Pd implantation and external beam radiation for T3c prostate cancer.
Combined brachytherapy and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) of the prostate and seminal vesicles (SVs) is evolving as a successful treatment option for high-risk prostate cancer. Dose-volume histogram (DVH) analysis of the SV was performed in patients with biopsy-positive SV who received implantation of the SV and prostate. Fifteen consecutive patients with high-risk features (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] > or =10 ng/mL, Gleason score > or = 7, or clinical stage > or = T2b) and a positive SV biopsy were treated with a 103Pd implant of the prostate and SV followed by 45Gy of EBRT. DVHs were generated for the prostate and total SV volume (SVT). In addition, the SV was divided into 3-mm-thick volumes identified as SV1, SV2, SV3, SV4, SV5, and SV6 starting from the junction of the prostate and SV and extending distally. Delivered dose was defined as the D90 (dose delivered to 90% of the organ on DVH). The median number of seeds implanted into the prostate and the SVT was 59 (41-94) and 9 (4-21), respectively. The median D90 values for the prostate, SVT, SV1, SV2, SV3, SV4, SV5, and SV6 were 103.2 (87.4-137.1), 46.2 (4.0-69.4), 76.0 (31.2-147), 63.4 (25.1-145.9), 49.7 (15.3-118), 27.4 (9.3-135.1), 14.2 (2.3-100.3), and 3.9 (0-61.5) Gy, respectively. Implantation of the SV using a real-time intraoperative approach is technically feasible and results in higher doses to the SV than has been reported with implantation of the prostate alone. Although dose distribution in the SV can be variable and unpredictable, these doses, in combination with 45 Gy of EBRT, may be adequate to control disease spread in these organs.

Assessment of postbrachytherapy sexual function: a comparison of the IIEF-5 and the MSEFS.
This study is to compare the Mount Sinai Erectile Function Score (MSEFS), our brachytherapy program's physician-assigned scale, with patients' independently completed International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5). A total of 1202 patients with T1-T3 prostate cancer were treated with ultrasound-guided radioactive seed implantation +/- EBRT with at least one visit where both MSEFS and IIEF-5 were completed. Spearman rho correlations were performed. The MSEFS significantly correlated with the total IIEF-5 scores on all comparisons. The coefficient was 0.65 for comparisons at initial consultation and 0.76 for all visits. The correlations remained strong, averaging to 0.76 for visits 1 through 10. In assessing erectile dysfunction after radiation, the MSEFS correlates well with, but cannot be replaced by, the IIEF-5, which is weighted toward one's degree of sexual desire. More insight into patients' erectile function after brachytherapy may be gotten if the IIEF-15 is used instead of the IIEF-5 with our MSEFS.
