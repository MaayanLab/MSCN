Prepregnancy body mass index, smoking during pregnancy, and infant birth weight.
Smoking during pregnancy is strongly associated with increased risk of small for gestational age (SGA) and low birth weight, whereas elevated prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) is associated with a decreased risk of SGA and greater birth weight. We investigated the combined effect of prenatal smoking and prepregnancy BMI on risk of SGA and on birth weight. A total of 34,928 singleton, term pregnancies in residents of New York City between 1995 and 2003 were evaluated in multivariable regression models of birth weight and risk of SGA. Increasing prepregnancy BMI reduced the risk of SGA and increased birth weight. The effect of prenatal smoking on birth weight and SGA diminished in women as their prepregnancy BMI increased, such that prenatal smoking did not significantly impact the risk of SGA among women who were overweight or obese before pregnancy. Prenatal smoking decreased mean birth weight by 187 g (95% confidence interval [CI] -337, -37) among underweight women, by 129 g(95% CI -170, -87) among normal weight women, by 46 g (95% CI -113, +20) among overweight women, and by 75 g (95% CI -162, +11) among obese women. This study suggests that the effect of smoking during pregnancy on SGA and birth weight is present in underweight and normal weight women but markedly reduced among obese and overweight women.

Gestational weight gain and birth outcome in relation to prepregnancy body mass index and ethnicity.
The obesity epidemic raises concerns about the impact of excessive and insufficient weight gain during pregnancy. We examined the association between gestational weight gain (GWG) and preterm birth, term small- and large-for-gestational-age (SGA and LGA), term birthweight, and term primary Cesarean delivery, considering prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and ethnicity in a cohort of 33,872 New York City residents who gave birth between 1995 and 2003 and delivered in hospitals elsewhere in New York State. Preterm birth (<37 weeks' gestation) showed a modest U-shaped relationship, with projected GWG of <10 kg and 20+ kg associated with odds ratios of 1.4 and 1.3, respectively, relative to 10 to 14 kg. The pattern was stronger for preterm birth <32 weeks' and for underweight women with low GWG and overweight/obese women with high GWG. Term SGA decreased and term LGA and birthweight increased monotonically with increasing GWG. Primary Cesarean delivery followed the same pattern as LGA, but less strongly. Although the study is limited by potential selection bias and measurement error, our findings support the contention that GWG may be a modifiable predictor of pregnancy outcome that warrants further investigation, particularly randomized trials, to assess whether the relation is causal.

Decline in smoking during pregnancy in New York City, 1995-2005.
The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) between 46 states and four major tobacco companies increased tobacco control funding and restricted tobacco marketing. In 2002, New York City (NYC) began a comprehensive tobacco control program that raised the price of cigarettes, banned indoor workplace smoking, and increased access to cessation treatment. We examined the temporal pattern of smoking during pregnancy, including ethnic variation in smoking prevalence, relative to the implementation of the MSA and NYC's comprehensive tobacco control program using birth certificate data. Using multiple logistic regression, we analyzed NYC birth certificate data to examine prenatal smoking during three time periods: 1995-1998 (pre-MSA), 1999-2002 (post-MSA, pre-NYC tobacco control), and 2003-2005 (post-MSA, post-tobacco control). Overall, 3.0% of 1,136,437 births included were to smoking mothers. The proportion of smoking mothers declined from 4.5% in 1995-1998 to 1.7% in 2003-2005. Compared with non-Hispanic white women, African American women had 2.46 increased odds (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.36, 2.55) of smoking during 1995-1998, and 3.63 increased odds (95% CI 3.39, 3.88) of smoking during 2003-2005, despite an absolute reduction in smoking from 10.4% to 5.0%. Puerto Rican women also smoked considerably more than non-Hispanic white women. These findings document a striking temporal decline in prenatal smoking in NYC concurrent with changing tobacco control policies. Targeted efforts may be required to address the increasing disparity in prenatal smoking between non-Hispanic white and African American and Puerto Rican women.

Maternal ethnic ancestry and adverse perinatal outcomes in New York City.
We sought to examine the association between narrowly defined subsets of maternal ethnicity and birth outcomes. We analyzed 1995-2003 New York City birth certificates linked to hospital discharge data for 949,210 singleton births to examine the multivariable associations between maternal ethnicity and preterm birth, subsets of spontaneous and medically indicated preterm birth, term small for gestational age, and term birthweight. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, Puerto Ricans had an elevated odds ratio (1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-2.0) for delivering at 32-36 weeks (adjusted for nativity, maternal age, parity, education, tobacco use, prepregnancy weight, and birth year). We found an excess of adverse outcomes among most Latino groups. Outcomes also varied within regions, with North African infants nearly 100 g (adjusted) heavier than sub-Saharan African infants. The considerable heterogeneity in risk of adverse perinatal outcomes is obscured in broad categorizations of maternal race/ethnicity and may help to formulate etiologic hypotheses.

Serum levels of perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate and pregnancy outcome.
The authors examined the association of serum perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) with self-reported pregnancy outcome in Mid-Ohio Valley residents (2000-2006) highly exposed to PFOA. Data on 1,845 pregnancies within the 5 years preceding exposure measurement were analyzed for PFOA, and data on 5,262 pregnancies were analyzed for PFOS. Generalized estimating equations were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Neither PFOA nor PFOS showed any association with miscarriage or preterm birth. Preeclampsia was weakly associated with PFOA (adjusted odds ratio = 1.3, 95% confidence interval: 0.9, 1.9) and PFOS (adjusted odds ratio = 1.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 1.7) exposures above the median. PFOA was not associated with an increase in low birth weight, but PFOS showed an increased risk above the median (adjusted odds ratio = 1.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 1.9) and a dose-response gradient. Birth defects were weakly associated with PFOA exposures above the 90th percentile (adjusted odds ratio = 1.7, 95% confidence interval: 0.8, 3.6). This study identified modest associations of PFOA with preeclampsia and birth defects and of PFOS with preeclampsia and low birth weight, but associations were small, limited in precision, and based solely on self-reported health outcomes.

Maternal smoking, preeclampsia, and infant health outcomes in New York City, 1995-2003.
A number of previous studies have reported an inverse association between maternal smoking and preeclampsia. Additionally, some have suggested that smokers who develop preeclampsia have worse maternal and fetal outcomes than nonsmokers who develop preeclampsia. The authors examined the relation of smoking to preeclampsia among 674,250 singleton pregnancies in New York City between 1995 and 2003. Although smoking was associated with a reduced risk of preeclampsia overall (adjusted odds ratio = 0.88, 95% confidence interval: 0.82, 0.94), no association was found for preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension (adjusted odds ratio = 1.04, 95% confidence interval: 0.90, 1.21). Furthermore, the apparent protection conferred by maternal smoking was restricted to women aged < or =30 years. Contrary to previous reports, the authors found evidence of a negative interaction between smoking and preeclampsia with respect to preterm delivery and birth weight; smokers who developed preeclampsia had a lower risk of preterm delivery, and a lower adjusted mean difference in birth weight, than would have been expected based on the independent effects of smoking and preeclampsia. These data suggest that smoking is only protective against preeclampsia without pre gestational hypertension, and even then principally among younger women. Additionally, smokers who develop these disorders have no increased risk of adverse birth outcomes relative to nonsmokers who develop the same conditions.

Neighborhood deprivation and adverse birth outcomes among diverse ethnic groups.
Living in a socioeconomically deprived neighborhood has been associated with an increased risk of adverse birth outcomes. However, variation in the effect of neighborhood deprivation among diverse ethnic groups has not been studied. Using linked hospital discharge and birth data for 517,994 singleton live births in New York City from 1998 through 2002, we examined the association between neighborhood deprivation, preterm birth (PTB), and term low birthweight (TLBW) (>or=37 weeks and <2500g). Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for PTB (<32 and 33-36 weeks) and TLBW were estimated using logistic regression. The aOR for PTB of less than 32 weeks for the highest quartile of deprivation compared to the lowest was 1.24 (95% confidence limit [CL] = 1.13, 1.36), for PTB 33-36 weeks was 1.06 (95% CL = 1.01, 1.11), and for TLBW was 1.19 (95% CL = 1.11, 1.27). Measures of association varied by ethnicity; aORs of the greatest magnitude for PTB were found among Hispanic Caribbean women (PTB < 32 weeks: aOR = 1.63, 95% CL = 1.27, 2.10; PTB 33-36 weeks: aOR = 1.32, 95% CL = 1.02, 1.70), and for TLBW among African women (aOR = 1.47, 95% CL = 1.02, 2.13). The mechanisms linking neighborhood deprivation to adverse birth outcomes may differ depending on individual ethnicity and/or cultural context and should be investigated in future research.
