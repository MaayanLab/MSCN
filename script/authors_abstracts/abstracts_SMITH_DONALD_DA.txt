Advanced lipoprotein testing: recommendations based on current evidence.
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level currently is used as the major determinant of lipid- and lipoprotein-associated risk for ischemic cardiovascular disease, and varying levels have become the standard goals of lipid-altering treatment. The predictive value of the LDL-C cholesterol level, however, often is less than that provided by other variables such as non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), and the number of LDL particles measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This article reviews studies that compare these different lipoprotein variables, describes advanced methodologies of lipoprotein testing, and suggests goals of treatment and clinical situations in which these tests might be ordered.

Treatment of the dyslipidemia of insulin resistance.
The increase in ischemic cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in persons with insulin resistance has been adequately documented elsewhere in this issue. Some of the most important risk factors for this increased mortality and morbidity are the lipid abnormalities, which form two out of five criteria for defining the metabolic syndrome, a definition focusing on risk factors for ischemic cardiovascular disease. This article explores the description, pathophysiology, and treatment of these atherogenic lipid abnormalities.
