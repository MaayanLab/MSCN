Tamoxifen metabolite isomer separation and quantification by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
Tamoxifen (Tam), the antiestrogen used to treat estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer is a pro-drug that is converted to its major active metabolites, endoxifen and 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OH-Tam) by various biotransformation enzymes of which cytochrome P450-2D6 (CYP2D6) is key. The usual Tam dose is 20 mg daily; however, the plasma active metabolite concentrations vary due to common genetic variants encoding the biotransformation enzymes and environmental factors (e.g., concomitant drugs) that inhibit these enzymes. Effective treatment depends on adequate Tam conversion to its active isomers. To monitor metabolite plasma levels, a novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed to separate and quantitate Tam, N-desmethyl-tamoxifen (ND-Tam), and tamoxifen-N-oxide (Tam-N-oxide), and the E, Z, and Z' isomers of endoxifen and 4-OH-Tam. Known standards were used to identify each metabolite/isomer. Quantitation of these metabolites in plasma was linear from 0.6 to 2000 nM. Intra- and inter-assay reproducibilities were 0.2-8.4% and 0.6-6.3%, respectively. Accuracy determined by spike experiments with known standards was 86-103%. Endoxifen, 4-OH-Tam, and their isomers were stable in fresh frozen plasma for ?6 months. This method provides the first sensitive, specific, accurate, and reproducible quantitation of Tam and its metabolite isomers for monitoring Tam-treated breast cancer patients.

Identification of CYP2C19*4B: pharmacogenetic implications for drug metabolism including clopidogrel responsiveness.
CYP2C19 is a principal enzyme involved in the bioactivation of the antiplatelet prodrug clopidogrel and common CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles are associated with adverse cardiovascular events. To assess the impact of the CYP2C19*17 increased activity allele in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) and Sephardi Jewish (SJ) populations and to determine the frequencies of additional variant alleles, 250 AJ and 135 SJ individuals were genotyped for CYP2C19*2-*10, *12-*17, *22 and P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) c.3435C>T. Importantly, CYP2C19*4, a loss-of-function allele, was identified in linkage disequilibrium with *17. This novel haplotype, designated CYP2C19*4B, significantly alters the interpretation of CYP2C19 genotyping when testing *17. Moreover, genotyping CYP2C19*17 changed the frequency of extensive metabolizers from ?70 to ?40%, reclassifying ?30% as ultrarapid metabolizers. Combining CYP2C19 and ABCB1 identified ?1 in 3 AJ and ?1 in 2 SJ individuals at increased risk for adverse responses to clopidogrel. These data underscore the importance of including *4B and *17 when clinically genotyping CYP2C19.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 1 March 2011; doi:10.1038/tpj.2011.5.
