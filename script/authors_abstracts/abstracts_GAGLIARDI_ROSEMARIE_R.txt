The variable pathology of kidney disease after liver transplantation.
Chronic kidney disease is a frequent complication in orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) recipients, observed in 10% to 60% after 5 years. We analyzed clinical and pathological data from 81 OLT recipients who developed impaired kidney function with a serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL or new proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis. All patients underwent percutaneous kidney biopsy. The most common reason for liver transplantation was hepatitis C virus infection. The mean time until biopsy was 4.89 years. At the time of biopsy, the mean serum creatinine was 2.0 mg/dL, Modified Diet of Renal Disease glomerular filtration rate was 38.7 mL/min, and 24-hr urine protein was 1.37 g. All biopsies demonstrated glomerular abnormalities, 42% showed primary glomerular diseases, and only 16% had evidence of calcineurin inhibitor toxicity. Electron microscopy was performed on 74 biopsies and podocyte effacement was detected in 88%. Mean postbiopsy follow-up was 20 months; eight patients progressed to end-stage renal disease. This study demonstrates universal glomerular abnormalities in kidney biopsies after OLT. The pathology is suggestive of diabetic nephropathy and hypertensive change, but there are also specific glomerular disease processes present. There is little calcineurin inhibitor toxicity in this group. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the causes of kidney disease in the constantly changing liver transplant population, and the need to change current management of these patients.

Surgical portosystemic shunts and the Rex bypass in children: a single-centre experience.
This study aimed to illustrate the indications for, and types and outcomes of surgical portosystemic shunt (PSS) and/or Rex bypass in a single centre. Data were collected from children with a PSS and/or Rex bypass between 1992 and 2006 at Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York. Median age at surgery was 10.7 years (range 0.3-22.0 years). Indications included: (i) refractory gastrointestinal bleeding in portal hypertension associated with (a) compensated cirrhosis (n= 12), (b) portal vein thrombosis (n= 10), (c) hepatoportal sclerosis (n= 3); (ii) refractory ascites secondary to Budd-Chiari syndrome (n= 3), and (iii) familial hypercholesterolaemia (n= 4). There were 20 distal splenorenal, four portacaval, three Rex bypass, two mesocaval, two mesoatrial and one proximal splenorenal shunts. At the last follow-up (median 2.9 years, range 0.1-14.1 years), one shunt (Rex bypass) was thrombosed. Two patients had died and two had required a liver transplant. These had a patent shunt at last imaging prior to death or transplant. Portosystemic shunts and Rex bypass have been used to manage portal hypertension with excellent outcomes. In selected children with compensated liver disease, PSS may act as a bridge to liver transplantation or represent an attractive alternative.

The burden of chronic kidney disease in long-term liver transplant recipients.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important risk factor for morbidity and mortality post-liver transplantation (OLT). This study focused on investigating the incidence and risk factors associated with the development CKD after OLT. We performed a retrospective cohort study of recipients followed at least 5 years at our institution. CKD was diagnosed and classified according to National Kidney Foundation and the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines. There were 231 patients, 64% men, 67% Caucasian, 16% African-American, and 17% others, with a mean age of 56 +/- 13 years. The mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of the population was 56 +/- 28 mL/min/1.73 m2. CKD was defined as GFR less than 60 mL/min; 144 patients (61%) were identified as having CKD. When these patients were compared to the non-CKD group, the former were significantly older (62 +/- 9 vs 52 +/- 12 years, P = .03), more likely to be hypertensive (59% vs 38%, P = .003), and required more antihypertensive medications (0.83 +/- 0.81 vs 0.52 +/- 0.77, P = .02); 26% of all patients had diabetes. However, the incidence of diabetes (43.3% vs 19.3%, P = .02) as well as the incidence of insulin dependency (21.6% vs 12.5%, P = .001) was significantly higher in the CKD population. Mean uric acid levels were higher in CKD patients compared to non-CKD patients (8.00 +/- 2.00 mg/dL vs 6.70 +/- 1.99 mg/dL respectively, P = .001); patients with uric acid more than 6.0 had a 1.7 risk of having CKD. CKD defined as GFR < 60 mL/min is highly prevalent in long-term OLT survivors. Older age, elevated systolic blood pressure, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and elevated uric acid levels are independently associated with CKD.
