The utility of cardiac sonography and capnography in predicting outcome in cardiac arrest.
Emergency physicians and intensivists are increasingly utilizing capnography and bedside echocardiography during medical resuscitations. These techniques have shown promise in predicting outcomes in cardiac arrest, and no cases of return of spontaneous circulation in the setting of sonographic cardiac standstill and low end-tidal carbon dioxide have been reported. This case report illustrates an example of such an occurrence. Our aims are to report a case of return of spontaneous circulation in a patient with sonographic cardiac standstill, electrocardiographic pulseless electrical activity, and low end-tidal carbon dioxide tensions and to place the case in the context of previous literature on this topic. Case report and brief review of the literature. In 254 cases reported, no patient has survived in the setting of sonographic cardiac standstill and low end-tidal carbon dioxide tension, making the reported case unique. This case should serve to illustrate the utility and limitations of combined cardiac sonography and end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement in determining prognosis during cardiac arrest.
