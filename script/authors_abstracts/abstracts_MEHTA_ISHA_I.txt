The effect of a chlorhexidine-based surgical lubricant during pelvic examination on the detection of group B Streptococcus.
The objective of the study was to estimate whether surgical lubricant used during pelvic examination alters the detection of group B Streptococcus (GBS). We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients undergoing GBS screening at the prenatal clinics of a New York City public hospital. Two specimens were collected from each patient, before and after a pelvic examination with Surgilube (Fougera and Co, Melville, NY), a bacteriostatic surgical lubricant. Test performance indices using GBS status pre-pelvic examination as the reference were calculated. Over 10 months, 168 patients were enrolled in the study. Twenty of 168 patients (11.9%; 95% confidence interval, 7.4-17.8%) tested GBS positive before the pelvic examination. Of the initial 20 GBS-positive patients, 10 tested GBS positive after the pelvic examination with surgical lubricant. The sensitivity of detecting GBS after the examination with surgical lubricant was 50%. Because pelvic examination with surgical lubricant may decrease the detection of GBS, obstetric practitioners should collect GBS screening cultures before the use of surgical lubricant.
