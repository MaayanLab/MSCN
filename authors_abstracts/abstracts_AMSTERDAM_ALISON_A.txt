Impact of obesity on hospitalized patients.
Obesity is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide and is a risk factor for cardiac disease, diabetes, and stroke. This provides a challenge for the physicians caring for this patient population in the hospital. Skin integrity, medication dosing, testing, and nutrition are all altered by obesity. We summarize some of the current data on caring for the obese inpatient. Unfortunately, few data on this unique inpatient population exist.
