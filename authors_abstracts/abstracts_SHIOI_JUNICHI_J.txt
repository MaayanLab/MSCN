Inhibitors of {gamma}-secretase stabilize the complex and differentially affect processing of amyloid precursor protein and other substrates.
?-Secretase inhibitors (GSIs) are drugs used in research to inhibit production of A? and in clinical trials to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). They inhibit proteolytic activities of ?-secretase noncompetitively by unknown mechanisms. Here, we used cortical neuronal cultures expressing endogenous levels of enzymes and substrates to study the effects of GSIs on the structure and function of ?-secretase. We show that GSIs stabilize the interactions between the C-terminal fragment of presenilin (PS-CTF), the central component of the ?-secretase complex, and its partners the APH-1/nicastrin and PS1-NTF/PEN-2 subcomplexes. This stabilization dose-dependently correlates with inhibition of N-cadherin cleavage, a process limited by enzyme availability. In contrast, production of amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD) is insensitive to low concentrations of GSIs and is limited by substrate availability. Interestingly, APP is processed by both PS1- and PS2-containing ?-secretase complexes, while N-cadherin and ephrinB1 are processed only by PS1-containing complexes. Paradoxically, low concentrations of GSIs specifically increased the levels of A? without affecting its catabolism, indicating increased A? production. Our data reveal a mechanism of ?-secretase inhibition by GSIs and provide evidence that distinct ?-secretase complexes process specific substrates. Furthermore, our observations have implications for GSIs as therapeutics because processing of functionally important substrates may be inhibited at lower concentrations than A?.-Barthet, G., Shioi, J., Shao, Z., Ren, Y., Georgakopoulos, A., Robakis, N.

p120 catenin recruits cadherins to gamma-secretase and inhibits production of Abeta peptide.
The gamma-secretase complex cleaves many transmembrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein, EphB and ErbB tyrosine kinase receptors, Notch1 receptors, and adhesion factors. Presenilin 1, the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase, associates with the cadherin/catenin cell-cell adhesion/communication system and promotes cadherin processing (Georgakopoulos, A., et al. (1999) Mol. Cell 4, 893-902; Marambaud, P., et al. (2002) EMBO J. 21, 1948-1956), but the mechanism by which gamma-secretase and cadherins associate is unclear. Here we report that p120 catenin (p120ctn), a component of the cadherin-catenin complex, recruits gamma-secretase to cadherins, thus stimulating their processing while inhibiting production of Abeta peptide and the amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain. This function of p120ctn depends on both p120ctn-cadherin and p120ctn-presenilin 1 binding, indicating that p120ctn is the central factor that bridges gamma-secretase and cadherin-catenin complexes. Our data show that p120ctn is a unique positive regulator of the gamma-secretase processing of cadherins and a negative regulator of the amyloid precursor protein processing. Furthermore, our data suggest that specific members of the gamma-secretase complex may be used to recruit different substrates and that distinct PS1 sequences are required for processing of APP and cadherins.

Wild-type but not FAD mutant presenilin-1 prevents neuronal degeneration by promoting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase neuroprotective signaling.
The role of presenilin-1 (PS1) in neuronal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling was investigated in primary neuronal cultures from wild-type (WT) and PS1 null (PS1-/-) embryonic mouse brains. Here we show that in PS1-/- cultures, the onset of neuronal maturation coincides with a decrease in the PI3K-dependent phosphorylation-activation of Akt and phosphorylation-inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). Mature PS1-/- neurons show increased activation of apoptotic caspase-3 and progressive degeneration preceded by dendritic retraction. Expression of exogenous WT PS1 or constitutively active Akt in PS1-/- neurons stimulates PI3K signaling and suppresses both caspase-3 activity and dendrite retraction. The survival effects of PS1 are sensitive to inhibitors of PI3K kinase but insensitive to gamma-secretase inhibitors. Familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) mutations suppress the ability of PS1 to promote PI3K/AKT signaling, prevent phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK-3 and promote activation of caspase-3. These mutation effects are reversed upon coexpression of constitutively active Akt. Together, our data indicate that the neuroprotective role of PS1 depends on its ability to activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and that PS1 FAD mutations increase GSK-3 activity and promote neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting the function of PS1 in this pathway. These observations suggest that stimulation of PI3K/Akt signaling may be beneficial to FAD patients.

Ligand binding and calcium influx induce distinct ectodomain/gamma-secretase-processing pathways of EphB2 receptor.
Binding of EphB receptors to ephrinB ligands on the surface of adjacent cells initiates signaling cascades that regulate angiogenesis, axonal guidance, and neuronal plasticity. These functions require processing of EphB receptors and removal of EphB-ephrinB complexes from the cell surface, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Here we show that the ectodomain of EphB2 receptor is released to extracellular space following cleavage after EphB2 residue 543. The remaining membrane-associated fragment is cleaved by the presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase activity after EphB2 residue 569 releasing an intracellular peptide that contains the cytoplasmic domain of EphB2. This cleavage is inhibited by presenilin 1 familial Alzheimer disease mutations. Processing of EphB2 receptor depends on specific treatments: ephrinB ligand-induced processing requires endocytosis, and the ectodomain cleavage is sensitive to peptide inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Leu-leucinal but insensitive to metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001. The ligand-induced processing takes place in endosomes and involves the rapid degradation of the extracellular EphB2. EphrinB ligand stimulates ubiquitination of EphB2 receptor. Calcium influx- and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid-induced processing of EphB2 is inhibited by GM6001 and ADAM10 inhibitors but not by N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Leu-leucinal. This processing requires no endocytosis and promotes rapid shedding of extracellular EphB2, indicating that it takes place at the plasma membrane. Our data identify novel cleavages and modifications of EphB2 receptor and indicate that specific conditions determine the proteolytic systems and subcellular sites involved in the processing of this receptor.

FAD mutants unable to increase neurotoxic Abeta 42 suggest that mutation effects on neurodegeneration may be independent of effects on Abeta.
Strong support for a primary causative role of the Abeta peptides in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurodegeneration derives from reports that presenilin familial AD (FAD) mutants alter amyloid precursor protein processing, thus increasing production of neurotoxic Abeta 1-42 (Abeta 42). This effect of FAD mutants is also reflected in an increased ratio of peptides Abeta 42 over Abeta 1-40 (Abeta 40). In the present study, we show that several presenilin 1 FAD mutants failed to increase production of Abeta 42 or the Abeta 42/40 ratio. Our data suggest that the mechanism by which FAD mutations promote neurodegeneration and AD may be independent of their effects on Abeta production.
