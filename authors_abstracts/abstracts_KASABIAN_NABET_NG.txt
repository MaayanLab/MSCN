Combined robotic radical prostatectomy and robotic radical nephrectomy.
A 60-year-old man with prostatic adenocarcinoma and an enhancing left-sided renal mass underwent successful combined robotic radical prostatectomy and robotic radical nephrectomy. We describe the initial report of this combined robotic procedure to remove 2 synchronous urological malignancies and describe our technique. An analysis was conducted of the operating room and postanesthesia care unit charges of this procedure compared with the 2 procedures performed independently.
