Kupffer cell activation by ambient air particulate matter exposure may exacerbate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
Owing to increased obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most prevalent liver disease in the United States. NAFLD is considered a component of metabolic syndrome, a cluster of disorders that also includes diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, arteriosclerosis, and hypertension. Exposure to ambient air particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters < 2.5 microm (PM(2.5)) is a risk factor for arteriosclerosis and lung disease, but its effect on NAFLD is unknown. PM(2.5) induces pulmonary dysfunction via Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation on alveolar macrophages. TLR activation of Kupffer cells, resident hepatic macrophages, and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine production have been shown to play a key role in NAFLD progression. We hypothesized that PM(2.5) exposure is a significant risk factor for the progression of NAFLD. Thus, following exposure of male C57BL/6 mice fed high fat chow (HFC) to concentrated air particulate matter (CAPs) or filtered air for 6 weeks, progression of NAFLD was evaluated by standardized histological assessment of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. In mice fed HFC, the hepatic inflammatory grade (3.00 +/- 0.00 vs. 1.50 +/- 0.71, P < 0.001) and fibrosis stage (1.00 +/- 0.00 vs. 0.60 +/- 0.52, P = 0.023) were both significantly higher in mice exposed to CAPs versus filtered air, respectively. Increased numbers of Kupffer cells contained PM in CAPs-exposed mice scores of (2.00 +/- 0.94 vs. 0.20 +/- 0.42, respectively, P < 0.001). PM exposure increased IL-6 secretion up to seven-fold in a dose-dependent manner by isolated wild-type but not TLR4(-/-) Kupffer cells (P < 0.050). In conclusion, ambient PM(2.5) exposure may be a significant risk factor for NAFLD progression.

Atorvastatin does not improve liver biochemistries or Mayo Risk Score in primary biliary cirrhosis.
Statin treatment reduces hypercholesterolemia and may be anti-inflammatory. Case reports noted decreased alkaline phosphatase and histological improvement following statin treatment in primary biliary cirrhosis. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term effects of statin treatment in primary biliary cirrhosis. A retrospective analysis compared clinical and biochemical data from 15 hypercholesterolemic individuals with primary biliary cirrhosis who were treated long-term with atorvastatin with an age and gender matched, primary biliary cirrhosis control group. A significant decrease in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (p < or = 0.002) was observed throughout atorvastatin treatment (median time 2.5 years). LDL-cholesterol levels in the control group were not significantly changed after 2 years (p > 0.050). No significant changes were noted in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and Mayo Risk Score in either group (p > 0.05). Long-term atorvastatin treatment reduced LDL-cholesterol in primary biliary cirrhosis, but there was no evidence of any anti-inflammatory effect.

Anti-CD16 autoantibodies and delayed phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in primary biliary cirrhosis.
Primary biliary cirrhosis is characterized by chronic hepatic inflammation and immune mediated apoptosis of bile duct epithelial cells. Delayed macrophage phagocytosis of opsonized apoptotic cells, noted in other autoimmune diseases, may promote inflammation. Recent studies suggest serum anti-CD16 autoantibodies contribute to impaired macrophage phagocytosis by blocking complement receptor 3 (CR3) signaling via CD16. Therefore, serum anti-CD16 levels and the ability of monocyte derived macrophages from individuals with PBC to phagocytosis apoptotic cells were compared to controls. The mean level of anti-CD16 IgM autoantibodies (0.86+/-0.62 v. 0.35+/-0.22, respectively, p=0.031) was increased in PBC compared to control sera, and mean PBC phagocytosis of opsonized apoptotic cells was significantly decreased compared to controls (23.9+/-12.2% v. 43.9+/-14.4%, respectively, p=0.020). However, PBC phagocytosis of opsonized apoptotic cells was not significantly affected by the presence or absence of autologous serum (20.8+/-13.5% v. 23.9+/-12.2%, respectively, p=0.560). PBC phagocytosis of opsonized apoptotic cells inversely correlated with CD16 (and CR3) expression levels on Day 5 after culture in the presence or absence of autologous serum (r=-0.546, p=0.033 and r=-0.519, p=0.042, respectively). Phagocytosis of non-opsonized apoptotic cells did not correlate with CD16 or CR3 expression (p>0.050). In conclusion, PBC macrophage phagocytosis of opsonized apoptotic cells is impaired, irrespective of serum factors and may increase hepatic inflammation.

T cell targeting and phagocytosis of apoptotic biliary epithelial cells in primary biliary cirrhosis.
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is characterized by loss of tolerance against ubiquitously expressed mitochondrial autoantigens followed by biliary and salivary gland epithelial cell (BEC and SGEC) destruction by autoreactive T cells. It is unclear why BECs and SGECs are targeted. Previous work demonstrated that the reduced form of the major PBC autoantigen predominated in apoptotic BECs and SGECs as opposed to an oxidized form in other apoptotic cells. This led to the hypothesis that presentation of novel self-peptides from phagocytosed apoptotic BECs might contribute to BEC targeting by autoreactive T cells. The effect of autoantigen redox status on self-peptide formation was examined along with the phagocytic ability of BECs. Oxidation of PBC autoantigens first was shown to be due to protein S-glutathionylation of lipoyllysine residues. Absence of protein S-glutathionylation generated novel self-peptides and affected T cell recognition of a lipoyllysine containing peptide. Liver biopsy staining revealed BEC phagocytosis of apoptotic BECs (3.74+/-2.90% of BEC) was present in PBC (7 of 7 cases) but not in normal livers (0 of 3). BECs have the ability to present novel mitochondrial self-peptides derived from phagocytosed apoptotic BECs. Apoptotic cell phagocytosis by non-professional phagocytes may influence the tissue specificity of autoimmune diseases.
