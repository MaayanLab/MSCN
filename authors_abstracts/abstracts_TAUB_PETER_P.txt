Hemifacial lipomatosis, a possible subtype of partial hemifacial hyperplasia: CT and MR imaging findings.
We present a case of hemifacial hyperplasia in an infant manifesting predominantly as lipomatosis and hemihypertrophy of the maxilla. To our knowledge, there is only 1 other case report in the literature demonstrating the MR imaging features of this condition. Our case was manifest almost exclusively as lipomatosis, largely lacking muscular hypertrophy/hyperplasia.
