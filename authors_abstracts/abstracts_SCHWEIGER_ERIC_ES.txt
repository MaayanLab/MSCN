Treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa by photodynamic therapy with aminolevulinic acid: preliminary results.
The current standard of care for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) includes antibiotics (oral/topical), retinoids (oral/topical) and intralesional steroids and is unsatisfactory. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 20% 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) has been used ?off label? to treat acne vulgaris and may hold promise as a therapy for HS. This open-label, non-blinded study investigated the efficacy and safety of ALA PDT for the treatment of HS using two blue light sources and intense pulsed light (IPL) for photoactivation. Twelve subjects with active HS enrolled to undergo ALA PDT once weekly for four weeks with follow-up visits 4, 8, and 12 or more weeks later. Nine subjects completed the study through the week 8 follow-up visit. Lesions were counted at each treatment visit at week 4, week 8 and at the final week. Mean lesion counts were 11.25 at baseline, 6.5 at 4 weeks (50.8% reduction), and 7.5 at 8 weeks (29.9% reduction). Mean Global Severity Scores were 2.2 at baseline, 1.5 at 4 weeks, and 1.8 at 8 weeks. Mean DLQI scores were 17.3 at baseline, 13.1 at 4 weeks (27.2% improvement), 14.00 at 8 weeks (19.3% improvement) and 14.0 (19.3% improvement) at the final week (16-62 weeks). Three subjects (25%) had complete clearance and no active lesions 4 weeks after the final treatment. Treatments were more tolerable for subjects treated with blue light than with IPL. ALA PDT may be a safe and effective treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa.

A patient with neviod basal cell carcinoma syndrome treated successfully with photodynamic therapy: case report and review of the literature.
Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) is a genetic disorder characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) in addition to skeletal abnormalities and other neoplasms. Difficulty lies in treating the large number of BCCs that develop in these patients. The authors report a case of a patient with NBCCS treated successfully with photodynamic therapy (PDT) using 20% 5-aminolevulinc acid and blue light. The authors also review the literature and summarize past case reports and series using PDT to treat patient with NBCCS. Based on their experience and the reports of others, the authors assert that PDT should become the first-line therapy in the treatment of multiple BCCs in patients with NBCCS.
