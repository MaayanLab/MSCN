Laparoscopy in Crohn's disease.
Crohn's disease represents a challenging operative dilemma. The nature of the disease increases the technical complexity of operations, their morbidity, and the likelihood of multiple operations. In this setting, the advantages of laparoscopic surgery, including shorter hospital stays, less adhesion formation, fewer wound complications, and faster recovery of bowel function, are particularly beneficial to the patient. Patients with Crohn's disease requiring operations in the elective and semi-elective setting can all be approached initially laparoscopically. The surgeon's skill set should include extensive experience in advanced laparoscopic bowel surgery as well as open management of Crohn's disease and its complications. Strict adherence to the basic tenet of bowel preservation is imperative. The operations most commonly performed for Crohn's disease include diagnostic laparoscopy, stricturoplasty, small bowel resection, ileocolic resection, colectomy, repair of fistulae, and gastrojejunostomy for bypass of gastric or duodenal disease. Postoperative management includes resumption of steroids, typically without the need for "stress-dosing," bowel rest for a short period, and pain control, which is also less than that experienced with a laparotomy.
