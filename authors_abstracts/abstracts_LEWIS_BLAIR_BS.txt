Enteroscopy: an overview.
Although the small intestine has long been considered the final frontier of endoscopy, a vast amount of progress has led to increased diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. With the increasing prevalence of capsule endoscopy, the need for enteroscopy also continues to increase. The endoscopic options currently available include double and single balloon-assisted enteroscopy, spiral enteroscopy, and lastly, intraoperative enteroscopy. The majority of published literature has focused on double balloon enteroscopy, but further studies have to provide information on the safety and yield of the newer techniques. Although intraoperative enteroscopy may be practiced less frequently, it has a role in the management of lesions that may not be approachable by other endoscopic means and a role in the guidance of surgical management.
