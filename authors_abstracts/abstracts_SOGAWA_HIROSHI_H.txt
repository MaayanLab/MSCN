Liver transplantation for hereditary tyrosinemia type I: Analysis of the UNOS database.
Arnon R, Annunziato R, Miloh T, Wasserstein M, Sogawa H, Wilson M, Suchy F, Kerkar N. Liver transplantation for hereditary tyrosinemia type I: Analysis of the UNOS database. Pediatr Transplantation 2011: 15: 400-405. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? Patients with HT-1 can develop progressive liver disease and have a high incidence of HCC. LT is indicated in patients with fulminant liver failure, HCC or decompensated chronic liver disease refractory to NTBC. To determine the need for LT and outcomes after LT in children with HT-1. Children with HT-1 who had LT between 10/1987 and 5/2008 were identified from the UNOS database. Of 11?467 children in the UNOS database, 125 (1.1%) required LT secondary to HT-1. Mean age at LT was two and half yr (s.d.?±?3.6?yr). Mean age at LT during the first 10?yr of the study (1.82, s.d.?±?2.86?yr) was significantly lower than in the last decade (3.70, s.d.?±?4.42?yr), p?=?0.01. Nearly half of the patients (58, 46.4%) were transplanted between 1988 and 1992. Overall, one- and five-yr patient survival was 90.4% and 90.4%, respectively. LT is a valuable option for children with HT-1 with fulminant liver failure or when medical treatment fails. The rate of LT for children with HT-1 has decreased and age at transplant increased over the last decade most probably reflecting the effect of early diagnosis and treatment with NTBC.

Liver and combined lung and liver transplantation for cystic fibrosis: Analysis of the UNOS database.
Arnon R, Annunziato RA, Miloh T, Padilla M, Sogawa H, Batemarco L, Willis A, Suchy F, Kerkar N. Liver and combined lung and liver transplantation for cystic fibrosis: Analysis of the UNOS database. Pediatr Transplantation 2011: 15: 254-264. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? A proportion of patients with CF develop cirrhosis and portal hypertension. LT and combined LLT are rarely performed in patients with CF. To determine the outcome of LT and LLT in patients with CF. Patients with CF who had LT or LLT between 10/1987 and 5/2008 were identified from UNOS database. A total of 182 children (<18?yr) and 48 adults underwent isolated LT for CF. Seven more children and eight adults with CF underwent combined LLT. One- and five-yr patient and graft survival were not significantly different in patients who underwent LT in comparison with patients who underwent LLT (patient survival: LT; 83.9%, 75.7%, LLT; 80%, 80%; graft survival: LT; 76.1%, 67.0%, LLT; 80.0%, 80.0%, respectively). The two major causes of death after LT were pulmonary disease (15 patients, 22.7%) and hemorrhage (12 patients, 18.2%). Bilirubin was identified as a risk factor for death, and previous liver transplant and prolonged cold ischemic time were identified as risk factors for graft loss in LT patients. LT is a viable option for children and young adults with CF and end-stage liver disease. Outcome of LLT patients with CF was comparable to the outcome of patients with CF who underwent isolated LT.

Orthotopic liver transplantation for children with Alagille syndrome.
AGS is an inherited disorder involving the liver, heart, eyes, face, and skeleton. Aim: To determine the outcome of LT in children with AGS compared to those with BA. Methods: Children with AGS and BA who had a LT between 10/1987 and 5/2008 were identified from the UNOS database. Results: Of 11 467 children who received a liver transplant, 461 (4.0%) had AGS and 3056 (26.7%) had BA. One- and five-yr patient survival was significantly lower in patients with AGS in comparison with patients with BA (AGS; 82.9%, 78.4%, BA; 89.9%, 84%, respectively). Early death (<30 days from transplant) was significantly higher in AGS than in BA. One- and five-yr graft survival was significantly lower in AGS than in BA (AGS; 74.7%, 61.5%, BA; 81.6%, 70.0%, respectively). Death from graft failure, neurological, and cardiac complications was significantly higher in patients with AGS than in patients with BA. Serum creatinine at transplant, prior LT, and cold ischemic time >12 h were identified as risk factors for death. Conclusion: Children with AGS were older at the time of LT and their one- and five-yr patient and graft survival were significantly lower compared to BA. Risk factors for poor outcome in AGS after LT were identified.

Limited efficacy and unacceptable toxicity of cyclophosphamide for the induction of mixed chimerism and renal allograft tolerance in cynomolgus monkeys.
To induce mixed chimerism and renal allograft tolerance in cynomolgus monkeys, cyclophosphamide (CP) and total body irradiation (TBI) were compared as part of a nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen. CP induced dose-dependent neutropenia and lymphopenia, but hematopoietic recovery was more rapid than that observed in the TBI group. Absolute B cell counts after CP were significantly higher (P<0.01) than those in the TBI group. With CP, a total dose of 200 mg/kg with CD154 blockade regularly induced multilineage chimerism. Nevertheless, the recipients failed to achieve long-term survival because of rejection (3 of 5), posttransplantation B cell lymphoma (1 of 5), and toxicities of CP (1 of 5). As previously reported, 3 Gy of TBI with either splenectomy or CD154 blockade induced mixed chimerism and renal allograft tolerance, with significantly less morbidity and mortality than that produced by CP. Thus, TBI is more effective and less toxic than CP as part of a nonmyeloablative regimen for the induction of mixed chimerism and renal allograft tolerance in cynomolgus monkeys.
