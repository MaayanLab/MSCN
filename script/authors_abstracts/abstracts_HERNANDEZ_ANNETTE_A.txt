An Integrated Approach to Treating Non-Offending Parents Affected by Sexual Abuse.
Childhood sexual abuse has been associated with a number of serious physical and psychological consequences throughout childhood and into adulthood for both child victims and their families. This paper describes the preliminary outcomes of a pilot group program to treat non-offending parents of sexually abused children. This group program is integrative in its approach combining elements of trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral and psychoeducational/supportive interventions to treat non-offending parents of sexually abused children. This study also focuses on outcomes in terms of parental post-traumatic distress and general family functioning.A small group of non-offending parents was recruited from a local child advocacy agency. Parents attended the twelve-week group program and outcomes such as parent post-traumatic stress and family dysfunction were examined. Measures of overall satisfaction and intervention feasibility were also examined at the end of the group intervention.Favorable outcomes included a decrease in parent self-report of post-traumatic stress and select aspects of family dysfunction. Seventy five percent of parents completed the group program. Satisfaction questionnaire responses demonstrated highly favorable perceptions of the group's content, leaders, and helpfulness.This study served as an initial step in the development of larger family-focused interventions involving parallel parent and child groups and focused family sessions. Outcomes may begin to shed some light on the need for more parent- and family-focused interventions in families that have been affected by sexual abuse.
