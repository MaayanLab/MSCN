Seasonal Influenza Vaccination among Homebound Elderly Receiving Home-Based Primary Care in New York City.
Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ?50 years to reduce influenza related morbidity and mortality, but vaccination coverage among community-dwelling elderly remains low. Homebound elderly receiving home-based primary care (HBPC) have fewer barriers to vaccination than other community-dwelling elderly. The Mount Sinai Visiting Doctors (MSVD) program provides HBPC to homebound elderly in New York City. This study assessed seasonal influenza vaccination coverage within an urban HBPC program and identified factors associated with vaccine refusal. A cross-sectional analysis of data from the 2008-2009 influenza season was completed and influenza vaccination coverage was assessed. The association between social, demographic and health-related characteristics and vaccine refusal was evaluated using bivariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression. Of 689 people aged >65 eligible for influenza vaccination, 578 (84%) accepted and 111 (16%) refused vaccination. In multivariable analysis, vaccine refusal was positively associated with female gender (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02, 3.35), black race (AOR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.28, 3.25), and living alone (AOR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.10, 2.67), and negatively associated with dementia (AOR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.37, 0.91). Seasonal influenza vaccine coverage in the MSVD program was high compared to nursing home and community-dwelling elderly. Offering patients vaccination at home without additional expense will likely improve vaccine coverage among urban homebound elderly. Understanding why vaccine refusal rates are higher among females, black patients, and those living alone should guide interventions to increase vaccine acceptance among this population.

Insulin resistance predicts re-treatment failure in an efficacy study of peginterferon-?-2a and ribavirin in HIV/HCV co-infected patients.
Few studies evaluated the efficacy of HCV re-treatment and the predictors of response in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. The role of insulin resistance as a predictor of response in this population is unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pegylated interferon-?-2a and ribavirin in re-treatment of HIV/HCV co-infected patients, predictors of sustained virological response, including insulin resistance, and the relationship between insulin resistance and liver histology. This prospective, multi-centered study included HIV/HCV co-infected patients with prior interferon-based treatment failure. Patients received pegylated interferon-?-2a and ribavirin for 48 weeks. Serum HCV RNA was measured 24 weeks post treatment to assess sustained virological response. Insulin resistance was defined as HOMA-IR >2. Correlations between baseline insulin resistance and steatosis, and/or cirrhosis were determined. Sustained virological response was achieved in 14/96 (15%) patients. 35% of patients with HOMA-IR < 2 (6/17) achieved sustained virological response vs 14% (5/36) of those with HOMA-IR between 2-4, and 7% (3/41) of those with HOMA-IR > 4 (p = 0.01). In multivariable analysis, insulin resistance and log?? HCV RNA were negatively associated with sustained virological response [AOR 0.17; 95% CI 0.05-0.64, p = 0.009, and AOR 0.36; 95% CI 0.14-0.93, p = 0.04, respectively]. Steatosis and cirrhosis correlated with insulin resistance (p = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively) but neither independently predicted sustained virological response. Discontinuations due to severe adverse events occurred in 8% of cases, and 2 patients died of unrelated causes. In HIV/HCV co-infected patients undergoing re-treatment, sustained virological response rate is low; those patients without insulin resistance are significantly more likely to achieve sustained virological response.

First Season of 2009 H1N1 Influenza.
The 2009 H1N1 influenza virus is responsible for the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. Within 5 months after its emergence in Mexico, it had affected more than 290,000 patients and caused at least 3486 deaths on 6 continents. This report provides information about influenza viruses, previous pandemics, and the virology, clinical features, and epidemiology of 2009 H1N1 influenza in order to elucidate the current pandemic and outline the questions that remain.

Mutations in the hepatitis C virus core gene are associated with advanced liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can promote the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Published data implicate the HCV core gene in oncogenesis. We tested the hypothesis that core gene sequences from HCC patients differ from those of patients without cirrhosis/HCC. Full-length HCV sequences from HCC patients and controls were obtained from the investigators and GenBank and compared with each other. A logistic regression model was developed to predict the HCC risk of individual point mutations and other sequence features. Mutations in partial sequences (bases 36-288) from HCC patients and controls were also analyzed. The first base of the AUG start codon was designated position 1. A logistic regression model developed through analysis of full-length core gene sequences identified seven polymorphisms significantly associated with increased HCC risk (36G/C, 209A, 271U/C, 309A/C, 435A/C, 481A, and 546A/C) and an interaction term (for 209A-271U/C) that had an odds ratio <1.0. Three of these polymorphisms could be analyzed in the partial sequences. Two of them, 36G/C and 209A, were again associated with increased HCC risk, but 271U/C was not. The odds ratio of 209A-271U/C was not significant. HCV core genes from patients with and without HCC differ at several positions. Of interest, 209A has been associated with IFN resistance and HCC in previous studies. Our findings suggest that HCV core gene sequence data might provide useful information about HCC risk. Prospective investigation is needed to establish the temporal relationship between appearance of the viral mutations and development of HCC.

Outcomes of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection and the impact of antimicrobial and adjunctive therapies.
Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is an emerging healthcare-associated pathogen. To describe the epidemiology of and clinical outcomes associated with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection and to identify risk factors associated with mortality among patients with this type of infection. Mount Sinai Hospital, a 1,171-bed tertiary care teaching hospital in New York City. Two matched case-control studies. In the first matched case-control study, case patients with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection were compared with control patients with carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae infection. In the second case-control study, patients who survived carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection were compared with those who did not survive, to identify risk factors associated with mortality among patients with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection. There were 99 case patients and 99 control patients identified. Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection was independently associated with recent organ or stem-cell transplantation (P=.008), receipt of mechanical ventilation (P=.04), longer length of stay before infection (P=.01), and exposure to cephalosporins (P=.02) and carbapenems (P<.001). Case patients were more likely than control patients to die during hospitalization (48% vs 20%; P<.001) and to die from infection (38% vs 12%; P<.001). Removal of the focus of infection (ie, debridement) was independently associated with patient survival (P=.002). The timely administration of antibiotics with in vitro activity against carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae was not associated with patient survival. Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection is associated with numerous healthcare-related risk factors and with high mortality. The mortality rate associated with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection and the limited antimicrobial options for treatment of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection highlight the need for improved detection of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection, identification of effective preventive measures, and development of novel agents with reliable clinical efficacy against carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae.

Acceptance of rapid HIV testing among medical inpatients in New York City.
Early diagnosis of HIV infection is important for both individual and public health. This study examined patient acceptability of routine, voluntary HIV testing in a New York City hospital serving East Harlem, a diverse community with an HIV seroprevalence of 2.6%. Consecutive admissions to the general medicine service were screened for enrollment between October 27 and November 22, 2005, and March 13 and May 9, 2006. Participants completed a self-administered printed survey and underwent rapid HIV testing. Of the 420 patients approached, 100 patients participated. The most common reason for declining participation was, "I feel too sick to participate." Participants were more likely to be men (odds ratio [OR] 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05, 2.77) and to be in a younger age group (20-49 years; OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.64, 4.45). Participants who reported one or more HIV risk factors were not more likely to answer "Yes" when responding to the statement, "I have risk factors for HIV" compared to patients who did not report any specific clinical or behavioral HIV risk factors (OR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.38,3.53). In addition, patients who reported one or more specific clinical and/or behavioral HIV risk factors were not more likely to have received prior HIV testing (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 0.58, 4.32). Three individuals were newly diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. Risk-based testing may be inadequate, as patients do not accurately assess risk and do not seek or accept testing based on risk. Routine, voluntary HIV testing is able to identify patients missed in the risk-based model of HIV testing, expanding the opportunities for timely diagnosis and intervention. In order to fully implement the new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for routine, voluntary testing, the optimal timing to offer HIV testing to acutely ill inpatients warrants further investigation.

Pneumatosis intestinalis in adults: management, surgical indications, and risk factors for mortality.
Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) is an unusual finding that can exist in a benign setting but can indicate ischemic bowel and the need for surgical intervention. We present a series of cases of PI in adults to illustrate factors associated with death and surgical intervention. We reviewed the radiology database of the Mount Sinai Medical Center for cases of PI between 1996-2006 in adult patients. Chi-square and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors significant for surgery and death. Forty patients developed PI over a 10-year span. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 20%, and the surgical rate was 35%. Factors independently associated with surgical management on multivariable analysis were age >or= 60 years (p = 0.03), the presence of emesis (p = 0.01), and a WBC > 12 c/mm3 (p = 0.03). Pre-existing sepsis was independently associated with mortality (p = 0.03) while controlling for surgery. Patients with the concomitant presence of PI, a WBC > 12 c/mm3, and/or emesis in the >60-year-old age group were most likely to have surgical intervention, whereas PI patients with sepsis had the highest risk for death. A management algorithm is proposed, but further research will be needed to determine which patients with PI may benefit most from surgery.
