Case report: silicatosis in a carpet installer.
Chronic exposure to talc in the course of carpet installation can result in pneumoconiosis. We present a case of a young carpet installer who was diagnosed with silicatosis of the lung. Review of occupational history revealed that the patient had been working as a carpet installer for approximately 15 years, since he was 15 years of age. The patient was exposed to talc in the course of his work. Exposure to talc in the course of carpet installation has not been reported as a possible cause of pneumoconiosis. In this article we review different causes of silicatosis and discuss chronic exposure in the course of carpet installation and development of pneumoconiosis. In addition, we also review the relevance of mycobacterial infection in cases of silicosis and silicatosis. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL OR PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE: Exposure to talc in the course of carpet installation should be added to conditions that can cause pneumoconioses, specifically silicatosis of the lung.
