Successful pregnancy following surgery in the obstructed uterus in a uterus didelphys with unilateral distal vaginal agenesis and ipsilateral renal agenesis: case report and literature review.
After surgical correction of unilateral distal vaginal agenesis, the obstructed didelphic uterus was able to harbor 2 subsequent pregnancies. There was a congenital anomaly syndrome of uterus didelphys, unilateral distal vaginal aplasia, and ipsilateral renal aplasia. Intuition suggests that later pregnancy would be in the unobstructed uterus. The purpose is to report pregnancy occurring twice in a previously obstructed didelphic uterus after surgical correction. A girl aged 13 years, 8 months presented with the syndrome of didelphic uterus, upper right hematocolpos, and right renal aplasia. Right vaginal marsupialization was done. Subsequently, she had 2 pregnancies in the right didelphic uterus. Pregnancy occurred in the obstructed uterus despite a large hematometra, extensive right pelvic peritoneal endometriosis, and hematocolpos. The surgeon should make every effort to preserve the obstructed uterus.
