Statins and the perioperative period.
Recent studies on the effects of statin use on perioperative morbidity and mortality suggest that statins may reduce risk during the perioperative period. However, studies published thus far either were retrospective nonrandomized studies or included small numbers of patients. Individually, none offered authoritative recommendations. However, in almost every study, preoperative statin use was associated with a substantial improvement in perioperative outcome. Thus, pending the publication of a large, prospective randomized trial, the preponderance of the evidence at this time suggests that perioperative statin usage may improve outcome in high-risk patients undergoing major surgery. Furthermore, even if statins are definitively found to be effective, additional studies will be necessary to establish the optimal timing of initiation, drug dosages, and length of therapy.
