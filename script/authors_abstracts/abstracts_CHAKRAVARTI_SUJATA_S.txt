Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in children.
Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive method for the in vivo monitoring of tissue oxygenation. Originally used predominantly to assess cerebral oxygenation, NIRS has gained widespread popularity in many clinical settings in all age groups. Changes in regional tissue oxygenation as detected by NIRS may reflect the delicate balance between oxygen delivery and consumption in more than one organ system. However, more studies are required to establish the ability of NIRS monitoring to improve patient outcome. This review provides a comprehensive description of NIRS in children.
