Does poor early metabolic control predict subsequent poor control in young children with Type 1 diabetes: An exploratory study.
Background:? We sought to determine whether poor metabolic control during the early stages of Type 1 diabetes mellitus predicts control during subsequent years. We hypothesized that poor control in the first year after diagnosis would predict poor control in the following year, and that poor control in the second year after diagnosis would predict poor metabolic control in subsequent years. Methods:? We conducted a retrospective review of a cohort of urban children treated for diabetes at our institution who were diagnosed between 1992 and 2005. We calculated odds ratios to determine whether control in Year 1 or in Year 2 predicted control in Years 3-6. Cox regression analyses were used to determine whether poor early control predicted progression to subsequent poor control. Results:? Metabolic control in the first year after diagnosis was not a good predictor of future control. However, poor metabolic control in the second year after diagnosis was highly predictive of poor control in subsequent years and predicted faster progression to poor control. Conclusion:? The findings suggest that poor metabolic control in Year 2 may be a predictor of subsequent poor metabolic control. Targeting prevention interventions to reduce non-adherence and to enhance metabolic control to families that show poor metabolic control in Year 2 may prove to be an optimum investment in terms of improved medical outcomes and enhanced quality of life.

Impact of maternal posttraumatic stress disorder and depression following exposure to the September 11 attacks on preschool children's behavior.
To evaluate whether conjoined maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression are associated with increased behavioral problems among terrorism-exposed preschool children (N = 116; 18-54 months), this study compared clinically significant child behavioral problem rates among the preschool children of mothers with PTSD and depression, depression alone, and neither disorder. Behavioral problems were independently rated by mothers and preschool teachers. Maternal depression and PTSD, relative to maternal depression alone, and to neither disorder, were associated with substantially increased child problems. Notably, maternal depression and PTSD were associated with increased emotional reactivity (relative risk [RR] = 5.9 by mother's and 3.4 by teacher's reports) and aggressive behavior problems (RR = 11.0 by mother's and RR = 5.9 by teacher's reports). This was corroborated by teacher ratings. Implications for intervening with terrorism-exposed preschool children are discussed.

Factors associated with service use among immigrants in the child welfare system.
This study investigated child, caregiver, and caseworker factors associated with greater use of family support services by immigrant families in the U.S. child welfare system. Among child factors, higher levels of internalizing behavior problems (Odds Ratio (O.R.)=3.60), externalizing behavior problems (O.R.=2.62) and a history of neglect (O.R.=4.23) were associated with greater family support service use. Among caregiver factors, prior reports of maltreatment (O.R.=6.77), a serious mental health problem of the caregiver (O.R.=6.86), cognitive impairments (O.R.=10.46) in the primary caregiver, the primary caregivers' history of arrests (O.R.=6.47) and domestic violence (O.R.=2.87), were associated with heavy service use. Caseworkers' training on cultural issues (O.R.=61.35), their concerns over bureaucracy (O.R.=25.38) and concern over rules and regulations (O.R.=6.08) were also associated with greater service use among immigrant families. This research suggests that use of family support services may be determined not only by the family's demographic factors and risk level but also by caseworkers' training in cultural competence and their perception of organizational problems.

Effect of maternal psychopathology on behavioral problems in preschool children exposed to terrorism: use of generalized estimating equations to integrate multiple informant reports.
To examine whether the number of maternal psychopathologies is associated with increased clinically significant behavioral problems in preschool children exposed to disaster, using child behavior ratings from multiple informants. Cross-sectional study. Lower Manhattan, New York, New York. One hundred two preschool child-mother dyads directly exposed to the World Trade Center attacks. EXPOSURES: Maternal disorders: 2 (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] and depression), 1 (depression or PTSD), or none. Maternal depression and PTSD were self-reported. Child behavioral problems were rated by mothers and teachers using a standardized behavioral checklist. For each informant, we created separate dichotomous variables that indicated whether the child's behavioral problems were severe enough to be clinically significant. We then used an analytic technique (generalized estimating equations) that integrates the child behavioral problem ratings by the mother and teachers to derive a more reliable indicator of clinically significant child behavioral problems. The rate of clinically significant child behavioral problems increased linearly relative to the number of maternal psychopathologies. The number of maternal psychopathologies was associated with a linear increase in functional impairment. Compared with children of mothers without psychopathologies, children of mothers with depression and PTSD were at greater risk for several clinically significant problems, notably, aggressive behavior (relative risk, 13.0), emotionally reactive behavior (11.2), and somatic complaints (10.5). Boys were more likely to have clinically significant behavior problems than were girls. Concurrent maternal depression and PTSD was associated with dramatic increases in the rate of clinically significant behavioral problems in preschool children, particularly boys, 3 years after the World Trade Center attacks.

Substance use and functional impairment among adolescents directly exposed to the 2001 World Trade Center attacks.
The relationship between exposure to the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks, increased substance use, functional impairment and mental health service use, controlling for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, was assessed through an in-school survey of directly exposed students (N = 1040) attending the five middle and five high schools nearest the WTC. The survey was conducted 18 months after the attacks. Students with one WTC exposure risk factor had a five-fold increase in substance use, while those with three or more exposure risks had a nearly 19-fold increase. Increased substance use was associated with impaired school work, school behaviour and grades. Students reporting increased substance use were nearly twice as likely to want help but were no more likely than asymptomatic students to receive services. Adolescents reporting increased substance use, without co-morbidity, were less likely to receive psychological services than others. Attention to the needs of substance-using adolescents exposed to disaster is needed.

Relationship between type of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder among urban children and adolescents.
This study examines the association between trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among 157 help-seeking children (aged 8-17). Structured clinical interviews are carried out, and linear and logistic regression analyses are conducted to examine the relationship between PTSD and type of trauma exposure controlling for age, gender, and ethnicity. Confrontation with traumatic news, witnessing domestic violence, physical abuse, and sexual abuse are each significantly associated with PTSD. Witnessing a crime, being the victim of a crime, and exposure to accidents, fire, or disaster are not associated with PTSD. These findings underscore the association between interpersonal violence and childhood PTSD.

Age at diagnosis, gender, and metabolic control in children with type 1 diabetes.
To examine whether age at diagnosis and gender affect early metabolic control in children with type 1 diabetes. Data on age at diagnosis, gender, pubertal status, and metabolic control were gathered by a retrospective chart review of children diagnosed between 1992 and 2005. Mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values were compared at five time points: at diagnosis and at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after diagnosis. At diagnosis, girls aged 6-12 years presented with significantly higher HbA1c levels than girls diagnosed at older or younger ages. Their HbA1c at diagnosis was also significantly higher than that in boys of the same age. There was no gender difference among children diagnosed at ages 0-5 or 13+ yr. At 6 months after diagnosis, only age at diagnosis was associated with metabolic control, with children diagnosed when older presenting with lower HbA1c levels. At 12, 24, and 36 months after diagnosis, there were no significant effects of age at diagnosis or gender on glycemic status. At initial diagnosis, girls in the 6-12 age group presented with higher HbA1c levels compared with boys and girls of other age groups. Although endocrine changes associated with puberty may partly explain the findings, more investigation to elucidate mechanisms accounting for the interaction of age and gender with glycemic status is needed.

The relationship between PTSD arousal symptoms and depression among mothers exposed to the World Trade Center attacks.
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with greater risk of developing comorbid depression. However, little is known about the relationship between specific PTSD symptom clusters and comorbid depression. Approximately 4 years after the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks, we examined the association between PTSD symptom clusters and depression severity among 64 mothers directly exposed to the WTC attacks. Severity scores were computed for each PTSD symptom cluster by summing symptom frequency. Partial correlations with depression severity were calculated separately for PTSD symptom clusters, controlling for demographic variables, time elapsed since the attacks, WTC attack exposure, meeting PTSD criterion A, and the other cluster scores. Higher arousal symptom cluster scores were significantly correlated with persistent depression, but the re-experiencing and avoidance symptom clusters were not. Subsequent analyses isolating shared symptoms of PTSD and depression from those unique to PTSD suggest a complex interrelationship among symptoms of arousal, numbing, and depression.

Impact of conjoined exposure to the World Trade Center attacks and to other traumatic events on the behavioral problems of preschool children.
To examine the long-term behavioral consequences of exposure to the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks in preschool children and to evaluate whether conjoined exposure to disaster and to other traumatic events has additive effects. Retrospective cohort study. Lower Manhattan, New York. A total of 116 preschool children directly exposed to the WTC attacks. Main Exposures High-intensity WTC attack-related trauma exposure indexed by the child experiencing 1 or more of the following: seeing people jumping out of the towers, seeing dead bodies, seeing injured people, witnessing the towers collapsing, and lifetime history of other trauma exposure. Main Outcome Measure Clinically significant behavioral problems as measured using the Child Behavioral Checklist. Preschool children exposed to high-intensity WTC attack-related events were at increased risk for the sleep problems and anxious/depressed behavioral symptom clusters. Conjoined exposure to high-intensity WTC attack-related events and to other trauma was associated with clinically significant emotionally reactive, anxious/depressed, and sleep-related behavioral problems. Children without a conjoined lifetime history of other trauma did not differ from nonexposed children. Risk of emotionally reactive, anxious/depressed, and attention problems in preschool children exposed to conjoined high-intensity WTC attack-related events and other trauma increased synergistically. Conjoined other trauma exposure seems to amplify the impact of high-intensity WTC attack-related events on behavioral problems. Preschool children exposed to high-intensity events who had no other trauma exposure did not have increased clinically significant behavioral problems. The additive effects of trauma exposure are consistent with an allostatic load hypothesis of stress. More vigorous outreach to trauma-exposed preschool children should become a postdisaster public health priority.

Additive interaction of child abuse and perinatal risk as signs of resiliency in adulthood.
To find the biological basis of resilience, we exploited data from a longitudinal community-based study of 1,748 adult children, followed from birth to adulthood. Results showed that those with both abuse and perinatal problems demonstrated synergistically impaired well-being, a higher rate of school dropout, lower sense of success, and lower income. Among abused adult children (n = 271), we found that those without, relative to those with, perinatal problems had lower risk for adult psychopathology. An examination of the biological base of resilience could be added in a multidimensional/multifactorial model to help researchers identify ways to promote resiliency even before birth.

Conjoined effects of low birth weight and childhood abuse on adaptation and well-being in adolescence and adulthood.
To characterize the conjoined effects of low birth weight (LBW) and childhood abuse on impaired adaptation and illness in adolescence and adulthood. Longitudinal study of a birth cohort. Baltimore, Md. Children (N = 1748) were followed from birth to adulthood (mean age, 26 years) as part of the Johns Hopkins Collaborative Perinatal Study. Childhood abuse and LBW. Indicators of adaptation were delinquency, school suspension, repeating grades, academic honors, quality of life, and socioeconomic status. Indicators of psychiatric and medical problems were depression, social dysfunction, somatization, asthma, and hypertension. Participants with both LBW and subsequent childhood abuse, relative to those with neither risk, were at a substantially elevated risk for psychological problems: 10-fold for depression; nearly 9-fold for social dysfunction, and more than 4-fold for somatization. However, they were not at an elevated risk for medical problems in adulthood. Those exposed to childhood abuse were more likely to report delinquency, school suspension, repeating grades during adolescence, and impaired well-being in adulthood, regardless of LBW status. For those with LBW alone, the prevalence of those problems was comparable with that of individuals without either risk factor. Children with LBW and childhood abuse are at much greater risk for poor adaptation and psychiatric problems than those with LBW alone and those with neither risk. Preventive interventions should target families with LBW children who are at greater risk for childhood abuse.
