Epidemiology of deep sternal wound infection in cardiac surgery.
The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and predictors of deep sternal wound infection (DSWI) in a contemporary cohort of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The early and late outcomes of patients with this complication also were analyzed. A retrospective study of consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery using a computerized database based on the New York State Department of Health registry. Data collection was performed prospectively. A university hospital (single institution). Five thousand seven hundred ninety-eight patients who underwent cardiac surgery between January 1998 and December 2005 including isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) (n = 2,749, 47%), single- or multiple-valve surgery (n = 1,280, 22%), combined valve and CABG procedures (n = 934, 16%), and surgery involving the ascending aorta or the aortic arch (n = 835, 15%). None. The overall incidence of DSWI was 1.8% (n = 106). The highest rate of DSWI occurred after combined valve/CABG surgery (2.4%, n = 22) and aortic procedures (2.4%, n = 19). Multivariate analysis revealed 11 predictors of DSWI: obesity (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2), previous myocardial infarction (OR = 2.1), diabetes (OR = 1.7), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 2.3), preoperative length of stay >3 days (OR = 1.9), aortic calcification (OR = 2.7), aortic surgery (OR = 2.4), combined valve/CABG procedures (OR = 1.9), cardiopulmonary bypass time (OR = 1.8), re-exploration for bleeding (OR = 6.3), and respiratory failure (OR = 3.2). The mortality rate was 14.2% (n = 15) versus 3.6% (n = 205) in the control group (p < 0.001). One- and 5-year survival after DSWI were significantly decreased (72.4% +/- 4.4% and 55.8% +/- 5.6% v 93.8% +/- 0.3% and 82.0% +/- 0.6%, p < 0.001). DSWI remains a rare but devastating complication and is associated with significant comorbidity, increased hospital mortality, and reduced long-term survival.

Predicting postoperative renal failure requiring dialysis, and an analysis of long-term outcome in patients undergoing valve surgery.
Previous studies have been unable to identify independent valve-related risk factors for the occurrence of renal failure requiring dialysis (RF-D) in patients undergoing valve surgery. The study aim was to determine the incidence and predictors of renal failure in these patients, and to create a model based on these risk factors that could serve as a tool to predict this complication. Between January 1998 and December 2006, a total of 2,690 consecutive patients (1,546 males, 1,144 females; mean age 64 +/- 15 years) underwent valve or combined valve/coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery at the authors' institution. The main outcome investigated was postoperative RF-D; other postoperative parameters investigated included hospital mortality, major morbidity, length of hospital stay, discharge condition and late survival. RF-D occurred in 70 patients (2.6%). Multivariate analysis revealed preoperative renal failure (creatinine >2.5 mg/dl) (OR = 4.3), endocarditis (OR = 3.0), congestive heart failure (OR = 2.4), reoperation (OR = 2.3), diabetes (OR = 3.1) and cardiopulmonary bypass time >180 min (OR = 1.7) as independent predictors for postoperative RF-D. Hospital mortality among patients with RF-D was 50% (n = 35) compared to a mortality rate of 3.2% (n = 87) in patients without this complication (p <0.001). The long-term survival of discharged patients with RF-D was significantly decreased compared to those without RF-D. A logistic equation which included the coefficients of the regression analysis was generated to calculate an individual patient's risk for the development of renal failure. The predictive accuracy of the model and validation was measured (ROC area under the curve = 0.750). Renal failure requiring dialysis is a well-known complication, particularly in patients undergoing complex valve operations, such as surgery for endocarditis and double-valve procedures. The poor long-term survival of patients with RF-D underlines the need to direct more resources towards the prevention and treatment of this complication in valve surgery patients.

Predictors and early and late outcomes of dialysis-dependent patients in contemporary cardiac surgery.
The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence and predictors of renal failure requiring dialysis (RF-D) in a contemporary cohort of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The authors also analyzed early and late outcome of patients with this complication. A retrospective study of consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery using a computerized database based on the New York State Department of Health registry. Data collection was performed prospectively. A university hospital (single institution). Six thousand four hundred forty-nine patients who underwent cardiac surgery between January 1998 and December 2006 including isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (n = 2,819, 44%), single- or multiple-valve surgery (n = 1,378, 21%), combined valve and CABG procedures (n = 1,032, 16%), and surgery involving the ascending aorta or the aortic arch (n = 1,220, 19%). None. The incidence of RF-D was 2.2% (n = 139). The incidence per type of procedure was as follows: CABG surgery (0.8%), valve/CABG surgery (2.7%), valve surgery (2.9%), and aortic surgery (4%) (p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed preoperative renal dysfunction (odds ratio [OR] = 5.5), hemodynamic instability (OR = 5.2), diabetes (OR = 2.6), aortic surgery (OR = 2.2), congestive heart failure (CHF) (OR = 2.1), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (OR = 1.9), and reoperation (OR = 1.8) as independent predictors of RF-D. The hospital mortality after RF-D was 36.7% (n = 51) compared with 2.9% (n = 180) in the control group (p < 0.001). Long-term survival after RF-D was significantly decreased (1-year and 5-year survival 48.5% +/- 6.1% and 28.7% +/- 7.2% v 94.5% +/- 0.3% and 83.5% +/- 0.6% in the control group, p < 0.001). Hypertension, CHF, and PVD were independent predictors of late mortality. The authors observed an increase in the overall incidence of RF-D compared with previous studies, probably related to an increased prevalence of patients undergoing more complex procedures with a worsening risk profile. Postoperative RF-D was not only associated with increased hospital mortality and morbidity, but also with a significant reduction of long-term survival in discharged patients. Seven independent predictors of RF-D were identified. Future research efforts should focus on a more precise identification of patients at risk and the development of new treatment modalities, which would potentially prevent the occurrence of this complication.

Early and late outcomes of cardiac surgery in patients with moderate to severe preoperative renal dysfunction without dialysis.
It is well known that end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis negatively impacts early and late outcome of cardiac surgery. However, data with respect to non-dialysis-dependent renal failure patients (NDRF) are limited. We retrospectively analyzed 6940 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery from January 1998 to September 2006. Patients undergoing cardiac transplantation and ventricular assist device implantation (n=246) and dialysis dependent patients (n=245) were excluded. NDRF was present in 135 (2.1%) patients (mean age 64+/-14, 38% female). NRDF patients were more likely to present with cardiac related risk factors including ejection fraction <30% (P<0.001), prior myocardial infarction (P<0.001), congestive heart failure (P<0.001), active endocarditis (P<0.001) and hemodynamic instability (P<0.001). The estimated odds (OR) of hospital mortality in NDRF patients was 6.6 (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis retained NDRF as an independent factor for increasing the risk of hospital mortality among patients undergoing cardiac surgery (OR=5.1, P<0.001). Patients with NDRF were more likely to experience major postoperative complications when compared to the control group. One- and 5-year survival in NDRF patients was 82+/-4% and 63+/-6%, respectively, and significantly reduced compared to the control group. NDRF is a strong independent predictor of hospital mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Preoperative renal dysfunction also adversely affects long-term survival in these patients.

[Remodeling annuloplasty using a prosthetic ring designed for correcting type-IIIb ischemic mitral regurgitation].
The most common mechanism underlying ischemic mitral regurgitation is restricted leaflet motion during systole (Carpentier's type IIIb). Annuloplasty is the preferred technique for surgical repair. The new Carpentier-McCarthy-Adams IMR Etlogix prosthetic annuloplasty ring was designed specifically to address the particular peculiarities of this condition, principally asymmetric annular dilatation. The aims of this study were to review the rationale underlying the creation of the ring and to report our early clinical experience. The study included 40 patients with type-IIIb ischemic mitral regurgitation (grade 3+/4+) who underwent mitral value reconstruction using the new prosthetic ring between December 2003 and June 2005. Their mean age was 68+/-10 years. Concomitant procedures included coronary artery bypass grafting (n=27, 68%), tricuspid valvuloplasty (n=10, 25%), and a modified Maze procedure (n=9, 22%). The mean predicted EuroSCORE mortality for surgery was 17+/-11%. In-hospital mortality was 2.5% (n=1). Major postoperative morbidities included one case of stroke (2.5%), one renal failure (2.5%), and four respiratory failures (10%). Predischarge echocardiography revealed no mitral regurgitation in 36 patients (92%) and mild regurgitation in three (8%). Long-term follow-up echocardiography was carried out in 36 patients (92%) after 15-34 months, and showed that the rate of recurrence of (grade >/=2+) mitral regurgitation was 3% (n=1). The Carpentier-McCarthy-Adams IMR Etlogix(R) annuloplasty ring was effective in correcting type-IIIb ischemic mitral regurgitation. Its novel three-dimensional asymmetric shape is designed to deal with the anatomical and pathological characteristics of the condition and its use may, therefore, result in an excellent long-term outcome.

Principles of reconstructive surgery in degenerative mitral valve disease.
Degenerative mitral valve disease is the most common cause of mitral regurgitation (MR) in developed countries. The most common etiologies of valvular regurgitation are Barlow's disease and fibroelastic deficiency. The mechanism of MR is type II dysfunction (leaflet prolapse) due to chordae elongation or rupture in most patients. Associated annular dilation is a common lesion in almost all patients with chronic MR. By means of segmental valve analysis, isolated posterior leaflet prolapse (P2 segment) is often observed in patients with fibroelastic deficiency, whereas the prolapse of multiple segments or bileaflet prolapse is typically seen in patients with Barlow's disease. In patients with degenerative mitral valve disease and severe MR, reconstructive surgery should be performed before the occurrence of clinical symptoms, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, and left ventricular dysfunction or enlargement. The goals of reconstructive surgery are preservation or restoration of normal leaflet motion, creation of a large surface of coaptation, and stabilization of the entire annulus with a remodeling annuloplasty. Today, reconstructive techniques are standardized, reliable, and reproducible, and therefore should be applied systematically to all patients with degenerative valvular disease.
