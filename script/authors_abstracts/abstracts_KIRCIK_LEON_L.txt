Rapid and efficacious fixed-combination monotherapy: desired results for the patient and improved adherence for the clinician.
Ideally, acne therapy should treat multiple causative disease factors and improve clinical symptoms while considering patient tolerability and expectations as well as other factors that could negatively impact patient adherence to therapy. This article reviews data describing the role of inflammation in disease pathogenesis and how it impacts treatment choice. Pivotal efficacy data supporting use of a fixed-combination monotherapy gel containing clindamycin 1% and benzoyl peroxide 5% (C/BPO) also are reviewed. This fixed-combination monotherapy demonstrates efficacy for the treatment of both inflammatory and noninflammatory acne lesions, both alone and in combination with a retinoid, which may favorably influence a patient's adherence to therapy.
