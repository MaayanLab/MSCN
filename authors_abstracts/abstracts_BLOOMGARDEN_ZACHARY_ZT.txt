Hypertension in diabetes: treatment considerations.
Treatment of blood pressure in the patient with diabetes remains a challenge. While data extrapolated from many trials seemed to imply that lower blood pressures leads to more favorable cardiovascular outcomes, this paper reviews newer trials designed to treat to blood pressure targets below 130/80 mmHg in patients with long term established diabetes, which showed that this goal may prove more harmful than helpful. In clinical practice this may be less relevant due to the fact that less than half of patients are even at the goal of 130/80. The interaction between glucose control and blood pressure control are also discussed, emphasizing the importance of multifactorial treatment.

Summary of the ACRE inaugural meeting.
The charter meeting of the Association of Clinical Researchers and Educators (ACRE) provided a powerful set of arguments against assertions that physician-industry collaboration is harmful and represents a "conflict of interest." Such collaboration has, in fact, improved medical care for patients, a case made overwhelmingly by patients and patient advocacy groups at the meeting. The contentions that physician-industry collaboration is problematic are not based on evidence. They depend on unjustified generalization from inevitable, sometimes egregious, but vanishingly uncommon adverse outcomes of industry-physician interaction without reference to how so much more commonly these interactions add value. Furthermore, the claim that physician-industry collaboration is unprofessional is refuted by rational scrutiny. Indeed, the term "conflict of interest" itself is vague, inviting subjectivity and deserving to be rejected. The unwarranted success of conflict of interest regulation has prevailed because of the failure of physicians, educators, and innovators, through apathy and intimidation, to pay attention to its fallacies and resist its dangers. It has arisen from activist ambitions and from misalignment between the purposes of medical practitioners, educators, and innovators and those of administrators in medical journals and in academic medical centers. The media and politicians have not appreciated these misalignments and have accepted conflict of interest arguments at face value. Regulation emanating from conflict of interest criticism is confusing, onerous, expensive, disrespectful, and damaging. Prohibitions against speaking about medical products inhibit physician and patient education concerning rapidly emerging and complex therapies. Input by physicians cognizant of compliance requirements into such presentations should be encouraged. Restrictions to the free flow of corporate support of academic health centers, professional societies, and patient organizations threaten to delay medical innovation and education.

Premicroalbuminuria in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a metabolic risk marker.
To determine the relationship between urinary albumin excretion and features of the metabolic syndrome in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 189 premenopausal women (mean age +/- SD, 28.9 +/- 7.7 years) with PCOS and 81 control patients (mean age +/- SD, 37.9 +/- 8.6 years) from a single endocrinology practice. Exclusion criteria were diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, use of lipid-lowering agents, and use of antihypertensive agents (except spironolactone). The urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) was measured in a random single-voided urine sample. Premicroalbuminuria was defined as an ACR >7 mg/g. The prevalence of ACR >7 mg/g was 31.2% in the PCOS group (N = 189) and 35.8% in the control group (N = 81). The metabolic syndrome was noted in 16.3% (27 of 166) of patients with PCOS and in 2.9% (2 of 69) of control subjects. Nine percent of patients with PCOS who had an ACR <or=7 mg/g but 30.9% of those with an ACR >7 mg/g had the metabolic syndrome. Patients with PCOS who had an ACR >7 mg/g had significantly higher blood pressure and alanine aminotransferase levels than did those with an ACR <or=7 mg/g. In the patients with PCOS who had an ACR <or=7 mg/g versus those who had an ACR >7 mg/g, no significant difference was found in frequency of use of metformin, spironolactone, or oral contraceptives. In women with PCOS, an ACR >7 mg/g was strongly associated with the metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure, and elevated alanine aminotransferase levels. It may be useful to consider ACR >7 mg/g as an associated sign of the presence of metabolic syndrome in women with PCOS.

Screening for and managing diabetic retinopathy: current approaches.
The anatomy of the eye and the pathogenesis, clinical features, and prevalence of vision impairment from diabetic retinopathy are described. Screening and risk factors for and treatment of diabetic retinopathy also are addressed. The macula and fovea play a critical role in vision. Several interrelated biochemical pathways involving aldose reductase, advanced glycation end products, and protein kinase C link chronic hyperglycemia with retinal capillary endothelial cell damage and dysfunction in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Vision loss and blindness from diabetic retinopathy usually are the result of vascular leakage or ischemia. Screening for retinopathy should be performed within three to five years after the onset of type 1 diabetes and shortly after the diagnosis of type 2 disease, with annual follow-up examinations in both types of diabetes. In patients with diabetic retinopathy, severe vision impairment is less common and less readily corrected than mild vision impairment, and vision impairment is more common and less readily corrected in elderly patients with diabetes than in younger diabetics. Modifiable risk factors for diabetic retinopathy include A1C level, hypertension, cigarette smoking, and dyslipidemia. Tight control of blood glucose concentrations and blood pressure can reduce the risk for and progression of diabetic retinopathy. Aspirin therapy and smoking cessation also are recommended. Dyslipidemia in patients with diabetes is associated with retinopathy progression and vision loss. Treatment of dyslipidemia provides cardiovascular benefits in patients with diabetes, but whether it provides vision benefits remains to be determined. Laser photocoagulation therapy reduces the risk of vision loss in patients with diabetic macular edema, severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, or proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Intraocular surgery may be used for patients with vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment of the macula. Therapeutic approaches used for patients with or at risk for diabetic retinopathy include drug therapy to reduce modifiable risk factors, laser photocoagulation, and intraocular surgery. Screening plays an important role in early detection and intervention to prevent the progression of diabetic retinopathy.

Hypoglycemia in the intensive care unit.
To review recent articles and evaluate hypoglycemia as a major complication of intensive insulin therapy in anticipation of emerging data from current clinical studies. Following the 2001 landmark Leuven study demonstrating that intensive insulin therapy in the surgical intensive care unit reduces mortality, many studies have evaluated aspects of intensive insulin therapy with respect to improved clinical outcome and the impact of hypoglycemia. Specific risk factors for hypoglycemia in the intensive care unit with intensive insulin therapy are diabetes, octreotide therapy, nutrition support, continuous venovenous hemofiltration with bicarbonate replacement fluid, sepsis and need for inotropic support. In prospective studies with a comparator group, the incidence of hypoglycemia in intensive care unit patients treated with intensive insulin therapy is up to 25%, corresponding to a relative risk of 5.0. In studies without a comparator group, however, the incidence is less than 7%. Hypoglycemia is associated with adverse outcome in intensive care unit patients. It remains unclear whether intensive insulin therapy-induced hypoglycemia per se is responsible for this adverse outcome. The threat of hypoglycemia is a barrier to intensive insulin therapy in critical care, supporting the need for frequent glucose monitoring, readily available concentrated intravenous dextrose infusions, better training of nurses and technological advances in glucose-sensing and insulin-dosing algorithms.

The proposed terminology 'A(1c)-derived average glucose' is inherently imprecise and should not be adopted.
The proposed use of a more precise standard for glycated (A(1c)) and non-glycated haemoglobin would lead to an A(1c) value, when expressed as a percentage, that is lower than that currently in use. One approach advocated to address the potential confusion that would ensue is to replace 'HbA(1c)' with a new term, 'A(1c)-derived average glucose.' We review evidence from several sources suggesting that A(1c) is, in fact, inherently imprecise as a measure of average glucose, so that the proposed terminology should not be adopted.
