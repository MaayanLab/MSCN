Association between second-trimester cervical length and spontaneous preterm birth in twin pregnancies.
The purpose of this study was to define normal second-trimester cervical length (CL) measurements and to estimate the association between second-trimester CL and spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) in twin pregnancies. A retrospective cohort of 309 asymptomatic patients with twin pregnancies who had routine outpatient CL assessment in the second trimester was studied. We looked at the gestational age periods of 16 to 17 6/7, 18 to 19 6/7, 20 to 21 6/7, and 22 to 23 6/7 weeks. We estimated the association between the CL measurement during each period and SPTB. A short CL was defined both as a CL at or below the 10th percentile for gestational age and 25 mm or less. We also performed regression analyses controlling for a number of clinically important factors: maternal age, chorionicity, in vitro fertilization, multifetal reduction, prior term births, prior preterm births, prepregnancy body mass index, and cerclage. The CL measurement at 16 to 17 6/7 weeks was not associated with gestational age at delivery or SPTB. At 18 to 19 6/7 and 20 to 21 6/7 weeks, the CL measurement was not significantly associated with gestational age at delivery or SPTB before 28 and 32 weeks. There was an association with SPTB before 35 weeks. At 22 to 23 6/7 weeks, the CL measurement had a significant association with gestational age at delivery and SPTB before 28, 32, and 35 weeks (P < .05). A short CL at 22 to 23 6/7 weeks was significantly associated with SPTB before 32 and 35 weeks (P < .05). In second-trimester twin pregnancies, the strongest association between CL and SPTB is at 22 to 23 6/7 weeks.

Weight gain in twin pregnancies and adverse outcomes: examining the 2009 Institute of Medicine guidelines.
To estimate whether the weight gain recommendations for twin pregnancies in the 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines are associated with improved perinatal outcomes. A cohort of 297 twin pregnancies was identified from a single practice with measured prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and weight gain during pregnancy. Recommended IOM guidelines were applied to our cohort based on prepregnancy BMI categories (normal weight, overweight, obese). Pregnancy outcomes were compared between patients whose weight gain met or exceeded the IOM recommendations and patients who did not meet these recommendations. Patients with normal prepregnancy BMIs whose weight gain met the IOM recommendations had significantly improved outcomes compared with patients who did not meet the IOM recommendations. They were less likely to have preterm birth before 32 weeks (5.0% compared with 13.8%) and spontaneous preterm birth before 32 weeks (3.4% compared with 11.5%). They also delivered significantly larger neontates (larger twin birth weight 2,582.1+/-493.4 g compared with 2,370.3+/-586.0 g; smaller twin birth weight 2,277.0+/-512.1 g compared with 2,109.3+/-560.9 g) and were significantly more likely to have both neonates weigh more than 2,500 g (38.8% compared with 22.5%) and more than 1,000 g (97.5% compared with 91.2%) and were less likely to deliver any twin with a birth weight lower than the fifth percentile for gestational age (21.5% compared with 35.0%). In women with twin pregnancies and normal starting BMIs, weight gain during pregnancy is significantly associated with improved outcomes, including a decreased risk of prematurity and larger birth weights.

Prediction of spontaneous preterm birth in asymptomatic twin pregnancies using the change in cervical length over time.
We sought to evaluate the change in cervical length (CL) as a predictor of preterm birth in asymptomatic twin pregnancies. We studied a historical cohort of 121 twin pregnancies with CL testing between 18-24 weeks who had a follow-up CL 2-6 weeks after the initial CL. A total of 19 patients had their CL decrease by > or = 20% (shortened CL group) and 102 patients' CL decreased by less, or not at all (stable CL group). The shortened CL group had a significantly higher rate of spontaneous preterm birth <28 weeks, <30 weeks, <32 weeks, and <34 weeks. This remained true even when excluding patients with a short CL (< or = 25 mm) on the repeated CL. In twin pregnancies, a CL that decreases by 20% over 2 measurements is a significant predictor of very preterm birth, even in the setting of a normal CL. Serial CL measurements should be considered in twin pregnancies, starting <24 weeks.

Outcomes of multiple gestations with advanced maternal age.
To investigate outcomes of twin gestations with advanced maternal age (AMA). Historical cohort of twin gestations cared for by a maternal-fetal medicine faculty practice. Outcomes of patients with AMA (70) and non-AMA (75) were compared. AMA was defined as age > or =35. Analysis including mode of delivery, gestational age at delivery and overall complications was performed. Significance was determined using the chi-square test or the Student's t-test. The Cesarean rate for AMA was significantly greater compared to non-AMA (80.0% vs. 54.7%; p = 0.001). The main reason for the increased rate was uterine dysfunction. The mean gestational age at delivery for AMA was significantly greater than for non-AMA (36.7 weeks vs. 35.4 weeks; p = 0.02). There were no differences in rates of other adverse outcomes including gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, suspected fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, low birth weight or low birth weight percentiles. This remained true when we compared the 32 women ages > or =40 years to 118 women ages <40 years. Among twin pregnancies, AMA women are not at an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, aside from an increased rate of cesarean delivery.

Influence of maternal body mass index on the clinical estimation of fetal weight in term pregnancies.
To estimate the effect of maternal body mass index (BMI) on clinical estimated fetal weight in term pregnancies. We compared the clinical estimated fetal weight to the actual birth weight on 400 consecutive term pregnant patients admitted for delivery. We then evaluated whether the maternal BMI was significantly associated with the clinical estimated fetal weight accuracy in estimating birth weight. Patients with singleton pregnancies at 37-42 weeks of gestation were included. Patients with an ultrasound-estimated fetal weight within 3 weeks of admission were excluded. Estimated fetal weight accuracy was defined as the absolute error (absolute value of estimated fetal weight minus birth weight) and absolute percent error (absolute error divided by birth weight multiplied by 100). The primary outcome was an absolute percent error of less than 10% (ie, an estimated fetal weight within +/-10% of the birth weight). The proportion of clinical estimated fetal weights within +/-10% and within +/-20% of the birth weight significantly decreased with increasing BMI categories (chi for trend P=.040 and 0.020, respectively). Clinical estimated fetal weights obtained in women with BMI at or greater than 30 were significantly less likely to be within +/-10% of the birth weight when compared with women with a BMI less than 25 (66.4% compared with 82.5%, P=.011). Body mass index was significantly positively associated with the absolute error (P=.046) and the absolute percent error (P=.011), even after controlling for birth weight. Increased maternal BMI is significantly associated with decreased clinical estimated fetal weight accuracy.

Successful bilateral uterine artery embolization during an ongoing pregnancy.
Uterine arteriovenous malformations are rare, potentially life-threatening, vascular anomalies. We report a case of a large arteriovenous malformation diagnosed during pregnancy that was successfully treated with bilateral uterine artery embolization at 20 weeks of gestation during an ongoing pregnancy. The procedure was uncomplicated, did not result in any fetal heart-rate changes, and, at 35 weeks of gestation, a liveborn male neonate was delivered through repeat cesarean without complications. Both the patient and her son are doing well more than 2 years after the procedure. Uterine artery embolization during an ongoing pregnancy did not result in acute complications to the fetus or mother.

The use of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17p) in women with cervical cerclage.
Our objective was to compare the incidence of recurrent spontaneous preterm delivery (SPTD) in patients with cervical cerclage treated with weekly 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) injections versus daily outpatient nursing surveillance (ONS) without 17P. Included in this retrospective cohort study were singleton gestations with cerclage placed at the discretion of the provider due to prior SPTD, delivering between January 1, 2004 and May 1, 2006. The study group (n = 232) consisted of women receiving once-weekly nursing visit and 17P injection. The control group (n = 1650) consisted of women enrolled for ONS (twice-daily electronic uterine contraction monitoring and nursing assessment). Data were further stratified by the number of prior preterm deliveries (1, > 1). Primary study outcome was the incidence of SPTD. No difference in rates of recurrent SPTD at < 37 or < 35 weeks were observed between the study and control groups. Study patients were less likely to be diagnosed with preterm labor (PTL) than controls (45.7% versus 70.8%, respectively; P < 0.001). The incidence of preterm premature rupture of membranes was similar between the groups (8.6% versus 8.1%; P = 0.770). We concluded that the incidence of recurrent SPTD was similar in women with cerclage treated with 17P or ONS, although women receiving 17P had a lower incidence of PTL. This benefit of 17P should be considered when managing patients with prior SPTD and cerclage.

Increased incidence of gestational diabetes in women receiving prophylactic 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate for prevention of recurrent preterm delivery.
Progesterone has a known diabetogenic effect. We sought to determine whether the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is altered in women receiving weekly 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) prophylaxis for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth. Singleton gestations in women having a history of preterm delivery were identified from a database containing prospectively collected information from women receiving outpatient nursing services related to a high-risk pregnancy. Included were patients enrolled for outpatient management at <27 weeks' gestation with documented pregnancy outcome and delivery at >28 weeks. Patients with preexisting diabetes were excluded. The incidence of GDM was compared between patients who received prophylactic intramuscular 17P (250-mg weekly injection initiated between 16.0 and 20.9 weeks' gestation) and those who did not. Maternal BMI and age were similar. The incidence of GDM was 12.9% in the 17P group (n = 557) compared with 4.9% in control subjects (n = 1,524, P < 0.001; odds ratio 2.9 [95% CI 2.1-4.1]). The use of 17P for the prevention of recurrent preterm delivery is associated with an increased risk of developing GDM. Early GDM screening is appropriate for women receiving 17P prophylaxis.

Increased recurrence of preterm delivery with early cessation of 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate.
The purpose of this study was to identify the effect of early cessation of 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) on the incidence of spontaneous recurrent preterm delivery (PTD). Retrospective analysis of data from women who were enrolled for outpatient 17P administration between January 2004 and May 2006 included women with previous PTD and current singleton pregnancy who were beginning weekly 17P injections (250 mg intramuscularly) at 16-20.9 weeks. The study group was comprised of patients who were electively terminating 17P at <32.0 weeks and who delivered >10 days from the last injection. The control group consisted of patients who received weekly 17P injections until PTD or 36.9 weeks of gestation. The primary study outcome was the rate of recurrent spontaneous PTD. Study group patients were significantly more likely to have spontaneous recurrent PTD at <37 weeks of gestation (48.1% vs 33.3%; P = .011), at <35 weeks of gestation (30.9% vs 14.0%; P < .001), and at <32 weeks of gestation (16.0% vs 7.0%; P = .020). Early cessation of 17P treatment is associated with an increased risk for spontaneous recurrent PTD.
