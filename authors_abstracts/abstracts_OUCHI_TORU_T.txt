Cellular commitment to reentry into the cell cycle after stalled DNA is determined by site-specific phosphorylation of Chk1 and PTEN.
In this study, we show that depletion of Chk1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) results in failure of reentry to the cell cycle after DNA replication has been stalled by exposure to hydroxyurea (HU). Casein kinase II (CKII) is degraded in these cells in a proteasome-dependent manner, resulting in decreased phosphorylation and PTEN levels. We show that phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser(317) but not at Ser(345) is required for phosphorylation of PTEN at Thr(383) by CKII, making cell cycle reentry after HU treatment possible. Like Chk1 depletion, loss of PTEN due to siRNA is followed by inability to return to the cell cycle following HU. In Chk1-siRNA cells, reintroduction of wild-type PTEN but not PTEN T383A restores the ability of the cell to reenter the G(2)-M phase of the cell cycle after stalled DNA replication. We conclude that, in response to stalled DNA replication, Chk1 is phosphorylated at Ser(317) by ATR resulting in stabilization of CKII, which in turn leads to phosphorylation of PTEN at Thr(383).

Loss of p53-regulatory protein IFI16 induces NBS1 leading to activation of p53-mediated checkpoint by phosphorylation of p53 SER37.
Our previous results that IFI16 is involved in p53 transcription activity under conditions of ionizing radiation (IR), and that the protein is frequently lost in human breast cancer cell lines and breast adenocarcinoma tissues suggesting that IFI16 plays a crucial role in controlling cell growth. Here, we show that loss of IFI16 by RNA interference in cell culture causes elevated phosphorylation of p53 Ser37 and accumulated NBS1 (nibrin) and p21WAF1, leading to growth retardation. Consistent with these observations, doxycyclin-induced NBS1 caused accumulation of p21WAF1 and increased phosphorylation of p53 Ser37, leading to cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Wortmannin treatment was found to decrease p53 Ser37 phosphorylation in NBS-induced cells. These results suggest that loss of IFI16 activates p53 checkpoint through NBS1-DNA-PKcs pathway.

Role of IFI16 in DNA damage and checkpoint.
IFI16 is a member of the HIN-200 family (hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear antigens with 200 amino acid repeat) that contains a DNA binding domain, a transcriptional regulatory domain, DAPIN/PAAD domain associated with interferon (IFN) response and a binding domain for BRCA1, breast cancer tumor suppressor protein. IFI16 has been identified as a target of IFNa and g and is a member of the HIN-200 family. Although series of initial studies have demonstrated a potential activity of IFI16, a physiological role of the protein was largely unknown. A novel insight of the function of IFI16 stemmed from the observation that IFI16 constitutively binds to BRCA1 breast cancer tumor suppressor. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that IFI16 is involved in p53-mediated regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. Immunocytochemical and immunohistological analyses of breast cancer cell lines and specimens revealed that levels of IFI16 are frequently decreased, supporting the notion that loss of IFI16 is closely associated with tumor development. Finally, siRNA-mediated depletion of IFI16 induces levels of NBS1, nijmegen breakage syndrome protein 1, leading to activation of DNA-PK (DNA-dependent kinase), phosphorylation of p53 Ser37 and accumulation of p21WAF1. Localization of IFI16 is determined by the status of BRCA1 protein under conditions of DNA damage, such as ionizing radiation (IR). More recently, it has been shown that levels of IFI16 are increased by oxidative stress. Together, these results illustrate that IFI16 is involved in DNA damage signaling and cell cycle checkpoint.
