Identification of SNPs associated with susceptibility for development of adverse reactions to radiotherapy.
Although cancer treatment with radiation can produce high cure rates, adverse effects often result from radiotherapy. These toxicities are manifested as damage to normal tissues and organs in the radiation field. In recognition of the substantial variation in the intrinsic response of individuals to radiation, an effort began approximately 10 years ago to discover the genetic markers, primarily SNPs, which are associated with susceptibility for the development of these adverse responses to radiation therapy. The goal of this research is to identify the SNPs that could serve as the basis of an assay to predict which cancer patients are most likely to develop complications resulting from radiotherapy. This would permit personalization and optimization of the treatment plan for each cancer patient.

Influence of pretreatment and treatment factors on intermediate to long-term outcome after prostate brachytherapy.
We describe how treatment factors influence biochemical freedom from failure, local control, freedom from metastasis and cause specific survival in patients treated with prostate brachytherapy. We followed 2,111 men who underwent brachytherapy a median of 6 years (range 2 to 17). Median prostate specific antigen was 7 ng/ml. Of the men 1,455 (68.9%) had clinical stage T2a or less and 1,428 (67.6%) had Gleason score less than 7. A total of 1,171 patients (55.5%) received (125)I, 221 (10.4%) received (103)Pd and 719 (34.1%) received supplemental external beam irradiation combined with (103)Pd. Post-implant dosimetry was done 30 days after implantation with doses converted to the biologically effective dose. Prostate biopsy was done 2 years after permanent prostate brachytherapy in 586 men (27.8%). Survival functions were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression with proportions tested by the log rank test. The 12-year biochemical freedom from failure rate was 78.6%, and stage, Gleason score, prostate specific antigen and biologically effective dose were significant predictors (p = 0.007, <0.001, 0.005 and <0.001, respectively). In 964 patients at low risk the biochemical freedom from failure rate was 88.1% and significant predictors were hormonal therapy (p = 0.030), prostate specific antigen (p = 0.026) and biologically effective dose (p = 0.003). In 499 patients at intermediate risk the biochemical freedom from failure rate was 79.2% with biologically effective dose a significant predictor (p <0.001). In 648 men at high risk the biochemical freedom from failure rate was 67% and significant predictors were hormonal therapy, Gleason score and biologically effective dose (p = 0.036, <0.001 and 0.012, respectively). The local failure rate was 7.3% with biologically effective dose a significant predictor (p <0.001). Prostate biopsy was positive in 21 of 121 cases (21.5%) for a biologically effective dose of 150 Gy2 or less, in 14 of 248 (5.6%) for greater than 150 to 200 Gy2 and in 3 of 193 (1.6%) for greater than 200 Gy2 (p <0.001). The 12-year freedom from metastasis rate was 95.2% with Gleason score a significant predictor (p <0.001). Cause specific survival at 12 years was 94.5% with Gleason score and biologically effective dose significant predictors (p <0.001 and 0.027, respectively). Permanent prostate brachytherapy yields excellent long-term oncologic outcomes. High biologically effective dose may need to be delivered to achieve successful biochemical freedom from failure, local control and cause specific survival.

American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) survey of radiation biology educators in U.S. and Canadian radiation oncology residency programs.
To obtain, in a survey-based study, detailed information on the faculty currently responsible for teaching radiation biology courses to radiation oncology residents in the United States and Canada. In March-December 2007 a survey questionnaire was sent to faculty having primary responsibility for teaching radiation biology to residents in 93 radiation oncology residency programs in the United States and Canada. The responses to this survey document the aging of the faculty who have primary responsibility for teaching radiation biology to radiation oncology residents. The survey found a dramatic decline with time in the percentage of educators whose graduate training was in radiation biology. A significant number of the educators responsible for teaching radiation biology were not fully acquainted with the radiation sciences, either through training or practical application. In addition, many were unfamiliar with some of the organizations setting policies and requirements for resident education. Freely available tools, such as the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Radiation and Cancer Biology Practice Examination and Study Guides, were widely used by residents and educators. Consolidation of resident courses or use of a national radiation biology review course was viewed as unlikely by most programs. A high priority should be given to the development of comprehensive teaching tools to assist those individuals who have responsibility for teaching radiation biology courses but who do not have an extensive background in critical areas of radiobiology related to radiation oncology. These findings also suggest a need for new graduate programs in radiobiology.

Development of an automated gamma-H2AX immunocytochemistry assay.
gamma-H2AX is emerging as an important marker of ionizing radiation-induced double-strand breaks. Development of a significantly automated method to quantify gamma-H2AX would have broad application in assessing physiological responses to radiation exposure. PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells grown on glass cover slips and 96-well plates were irradiated and assessed for gamma-H2AX focus formation by immunofluorescence analysis. The gamma-H2AX immunofluorescence staining was performed either manually or by using a preprogrammed automated robotic liquid handling system. A computer-controlled charge-coupled device camera acquired images serially throughout the thickness of each cell. Image analysis was performed manually and/or with automated image segmentation software. A robust relationship between radiation dose and gamma-H2AX focus numbers was demonstrated with both manual and automated image analysis methods, with excellent agreement observed between the two techniques. The r(2) correlation coefficients and Z factors exceeded 0.9 and 0.5, respectively, when gamma-H2AX focus formation was correlated with radiation dose using the automated technique. Inhibition of gamma-H2AX foci by drugs readily detected with this assay. Robotic specimen preparation with automated image acquisition and analysis can be used to quantify gamma-H2AX foci in irradiated cells, and the results agree well those obtained by manual counts. These data suggest that this assay has an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and is suitable for high-throughput applications.

Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in SOD2, XRCC1 and XRCC3 with susceptibility for the development of adverse effects resulting from radiotherapy for prostate cancer.
The objective of this study was to determine whether an association exists between certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which have previously been linked with adverse normal tissue effects resulting from radiotherapy, and the development of radiation injury resulting from radiotherapy for prostate cancer. A total of 135 consecutive patients with clinically localized prostate cancer and a minimum of 1 year of follow-up who had been treated with radiation therapy, either brachytherapy alone or in combination with external-beam radiotherapy, with or without hormone therapy, were genotyped for SNPs in SOD2, XRCC1 and XRCC3. Three common late tissue toxicities were investigated: late rectal bleeding, urinary morbidity, and erectile dysfunction. Patients with the XRCC1 rs25489 G/A (Arg280His) genotype were more likely to develop erectile dysfunction after irradiation than patients who had the G/G genotype (67% compared to 24%; P=0.048). In addition, patients who had the SOD2 rs4880 T/C (Val16Ala) genotype exhibited a significant increase in grade 2 late rectal bleeding compared to patients who had either the C/C or T/T genotype for this SNP (8% compared to 0%; P=0.02). Finally, patients with the combination of the SOD2 rs4880 C/T genotype and XRCC3 rs861539 T/C (Thr241Met) genotype experienced a significant increase in grade 2 late rectal bleeding compared to patients without this particular genotypic arrangement (14% compared to 1%; P=0.002). These results suggest that SNPs in the SOD2, XRCC1 and XRCC3 genes are associated with the development of late radiation injury in patients treated with radiation therapy for prostate adenocarcinoma.

p53 gene mutations in SKH-1 mouse tumors differentially induced by UVB and combined subcarcinogenic benzo[a]pyrene and UVA.
We compared the frequency and spectra of p53 mutations in skin tumors from UVB-irradiated and benzo(a)pyrene-UVA-treated SKH-1 mice. Analysis of p53 mutations using a combination of polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and sequencing shows that the frequency and spectrum of p53 mutations in BaP-UVA-induced tumors are quite different from those in UVB-induced tumors. SKH-1 mice were treated with BaP-UVA or UVB for 30 weeks after which skin tumors were collected for analysis of p53 mutations. Among the 11 BaP-UVA-induced tumors with diameters of 5-10 mm, two displayed mutations in exon 8 yielding a mutation frequency of 18.2%. In contrast, the mutation frequency among BaP-UVA-induced tumors was 10.5%. In UVB-induced tumors, the mutation frequency in exon 8 was highly correlated with tumor size. A total of 77.8% of tumors with diameters larger than 10 mm contained p53 mutations. The overall mutation frequency among UVB-induced tumors was 17.9% in exon 8 and only 3.8% in exon 5. Hotspots for p53 mutation in UVB-induced tumors were found at codons 128 and 149 (exon 5), and at codons 268, 270, 271 and 273-276 (exon 8). In addition to widely recognized C-->T missense mutations, there were also tandem CC-->AG changes coupled with either an insertion of T, a C-->G substitution or G-->C/T mutations. All of the mutations were found at tri- or tetra-pyrimidine sites. Thirty-nine per cent of all p53 mutations occurred at codons 274 and 275; 53% occurred at codons 268-271. Two multiple mutation clusters were located at codons 268-271 and 274-276. Both BaP-UVA and UVB caused C-->T transitions at codon 275 in exon 8. A C-->T mutation at codon 294 was induced only by BaP-UVA treatment. In contrast to UVB treatment, BaP-UVA treatment did not induce any mutations in exon 5. We show that individually subcarcinogenic levels of BaP and UVA synergistically induce a novel p53-mutation fingerprint. This fingerprint could serve as a prognostic indicator for the development of BaP-UVA-induced skin tumors.

Stereotactic radiosurgery for thoracic malignancies.
Radiosurgery for lung cancer is a novel and promising concept that warrants thorough review. Stereotactic body radiotherapy enables the selective delivery of an intense dose of high-energy radiation to destroy a tumor with precise targeting. The radiobiology and physics behind the use of radiosurgery are presented, followed by a discussion of promising retrospective and prospective clinical data that has been reported from Japan, Europe, and the United States. The article closes with a discussion of multidisciplinary approaches that include radiosurgery which are on the therapeutic horizon.

TGFB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with adverse quality of life in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.
To investigate whether the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within TGFB1 might be predictive for the development of adverse quality-of-life outcomes in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. A total of 141 prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy were screened for SNPs in TGFB1 using DNA sequencing. Three quality-of-life outcomes were investigated: (1) prospective decline in erectile function, (2) urinary quality of life, and (3) rectal bleeding. Median follow-up was 51.3 months (range, 12-138 months; SD, 24.4 months). Those patients who possessed either the T/T genotype at position -509, the C/C genotype at position 869 (pro/pro, codon 10) or the G/C genotype at position 915 (arg/pro, codon 25) were significantly associated with the development of a decline in erectile function compared with those who did not have these genotypes: 56% (9 of 16) vs. 24% (11 of 45) (p = 0.02). In addition, patients with the -509 T/T genotype had a significantly increased risk of developing late rectal bleeding compared with those who had either the C/T or C/C genotype at this position: 55% (6 of 11) vs. 26% (34 of 130) (p = 0.05). Possession of certain TGFB1 genotypes is associated with the development of both erectile dysfunction and late rectal bleeding in patients treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Therefore, identification of patients harboring these genotypes may represent a means to predict which men are most likely to suffer from poor quality-of-life outcomes after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.

Possession of ATM sequence variants as predictor for late normal tissue responses in breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.
The ATM gene product is a central component of cell cycle regulation and genomic surveillance. We hypothesized that DNA sequence alterations in ATM predict for adverse effects after external beam radiotherapy for early breast cancer. A total of 131 patients with a minimum of 2 years follow-up who had undergone breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy were screened for sequence alterations in ATM using DNA from blood lymphocytes. Genetic variants were identified using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group late morbidity scoring schemes for skin and subcutaneous tissues were applied to quantify the radiation-induced effects. Of the 131 patients, 51 possessed ATM sequence alterations located within exons or in short intron regions flanking each exon that encompass putative splice site regions. Of these 51 patients, 21 (41%) exhibited a minimum of a Grade 2 late radiation response. In contrast, of the 80 patients without an ATM sequence variation, only 18 (23%) had radiation-induced adverse responses, for an odds ratio of 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.2). Fifteen patients were heterozygous for the G-->A polymorphism at nucleotide 5557, which causes substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid at position 1853 of the ATM protein. Of these 15 patients, 8 (53%) exhibited a Grade 2-4 late response compared with 31 (27%) of the 116 patients without this alteration, for an odds ratio of 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-9.4). Sequence variants located in the ATM gene, in particular the 5557 G-->A polymorphism, may predict for late adverse radiation responses in breast cancer patients.

A genetically determined dose-volume histogram predicts for rectal bleeding among patients treated with prostate brachytherapy.
To examine whether possession of genetic alterations in the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia) gene is associated with rectal bleeding in a dose-dependent and volume-dependent manner. One hundred eight prostate cancer patients who underwent brachytherapy using either an (125)I implant, a (103)Pd implant, or the combination of external beam radiotherapy with a (103)Pd implant and had a minimum of 1 year follow-up were screened for DNA sequence variations in the 62 coding exons of the ATM gene using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. Rectal dose was reported as the volume (in cubic centimeters) of rectum receiving the brachytherapy prescription dose. The two-sided Fisher exact test was used to compare differences in proportions. A significant correlation between the presence of any ATM sequence alteration and Grade 1 to 2 proctitis was obtained when the radiation dose to rectal tissue was quantified. Rectal bleeding occurred in 4 of 13 patients (31%) with a variant versus 1 of 23 (4%) without a genetic alteration for patients who had <0.7 cm(3) of rectal tissue receiving the implant prescription dose (p = 0.05). Of patients in whom 0.7-1.4 cm(3) of the rectum received the implant prescription, 4 of 11 (36%) with an ATM alteration exhibited Grade 1 to 2 proctitis, whereas 1 of 21 (5%) without a variant (p = 0.04) developed this radiation-induced late effect. The possession of genetic variants in the ATM gene is associated with the development of radiation-induced proctitis after prostate cancer radiotherapy for patients who receive the full prescription dose to either a low or a moderate volume of rectal tissue.

Radiobiological rationale and clinical implications of hypofractionated radiation therapy.
Recent clinical trials of hypofractionated radiation treatment have provided critical insights into the safety and efficacy of hypofractionation. However, there remains much controversy in the field, both at the level of clinical practice and in our understanding of the underlying radiobiological mechanisms. In this article, we review the clinical literature on hypofractionated radiation treatment for breast, prostate, and other malignancies. We highlight several ongoing clinical trials that compare outcomes of a hypofractionated approach versus those obtained with a conventional approach. Lastly, we outline some of the preclinical and clinical evidence that argue in favor of differential radiobiological mechanisms underlying hypofractionated radiation treatment. Emerging data from the ongoing studies will help to better define and guide the rational use of hypofractionation in future years.
