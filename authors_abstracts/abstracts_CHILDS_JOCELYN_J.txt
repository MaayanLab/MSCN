Psychosocial snapshots: perinatally infected HIV+ adolescents' sexual behaviors and pregnancies.
Perinatally infected HIV+ adolescents are confronted with unique psychosocial challenges as they navigate sexual behaviors and pregnancies. How their health and the nature of their chronic illness affect the normal developmental challenges of adolescence is explored through case vignettes taken from social workers' clinical practice at an East Harlem Medical Center. The successes and difficulties faced by both the patient and the practitioner are illustrated.
