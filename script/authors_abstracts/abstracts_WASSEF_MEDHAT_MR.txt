Spinal perianal block: a prospective, randomized, double-blind comparison with spinal saddle block.
In this prospective, randomized, double-blind study, we evaluated whether a very low dose of spinal bupivacaine could be sufficient for safe performance of short perianal surgery. Eighty patients were randomly assigned to receive hyperbaric bupivacaine doses of either 1.5 mg (n = 40) or 6.0 mg (n = 40). The lower dose produced satisfactory anesthesia with a more limited block (median S4; P < 0.01), earlier time to ambulation (98 vs 147 min; P < 0.01), and hospital discharge (126 vs 249 min; P < 0.01), compared with the higher spinal dose. The use of 1.5 mg spinal bupivacaine can be successful for short perianal surgery.
