Association of SPINK5 gene polymorphisms with atopic dermatitis in Northeast China.
Background? Defect in the SPINK5 gene is known to be implicated in Netherton syndrome (NS), and has been suggested to be a locus predisposing to atopy in general. Coding polymorphisms in SPINK5 exons 13, 14 and 26 have been reported to be associated with atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma and high level of IgE. Objectives? To examine whether the SPINK5 gene polymorphisms are associated with AD in Northeast China, and to assess how variants influence selected phenotypic traits. Methods? A case-control study was conducted on four non-synonymous polymorphisms in the coding region of SPINK5 in AD and controls. The SPINK5 gene polymorphisms were analyzed using the PCR and RFLP methods. Results? For the four non-synonymous SNPs, A1103G(Asn368Ser), G1156A(Asp386Asn), G1258A(Glu420Lys), G2475T(Glu825Asp) in SPINK5, the allelic frequencies in the AD cohort were 0.55 for 1103G, 0.57 for 1156A, 0.54for 1258A, 0.62 for 2475T, consistent with those already published in the original British and Japanese cohorts. The T allele of SNP 2475G?>?T was found to be significantly associated with AD. There were significant differences in genotype frequencies for G1258A(Glu420Lys) and G2475T(Glu825Asp) but not for A1103G(Asn368Ser) and G1156A(Asp386Asn). Genotypes GA(420Glu/Lys), TT (2475Asp/Asp) and GT(2475Glu/Asp) were significantly more frequent in AD. However, the SPINK5 gene polymorphisms was found not to be associated with AD in regard to either serum IgE levels, concurrent allergic asthma or early onset of AD. Conclusions? Our study confirms the association between SPINK5 and AD.

Feasibility of immunocytochemical detection of tumor markers (XIAP, phosphohistone H1 and p63) in FNA cellblock samples from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
One of the major handicaps in contemporary clinical oncology is the inability to predict the responsiveness of any individual's malignancy to specific therapies. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of immunocytochemically detecting markers that may be affected by therapy or are predictive of therapeutic responsiveness, including phosphohistone H1 (anti-p-H1 MoAb 12D11) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) in small samples obtained via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy procedure, thus improving therapeutic monitoring. p63, a squamous stem cell regulatory protein, was also examined. These three markers were studied in FNA cell block samples of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Twenty-eight alcohol-fixed formalin-postfixed paraffin-embedded cell-block samples from FNAs of patients with HNSCC were subjected to antigen retrieval and then incubated with anti-XIAP, anti-p-H1, and anti-p63, and developed using EnVision-Plus reagents and diaminobenzidine as chromagen; Granular or heterogeneous cytoplasmic staining for XIAP and nuclear staining for p63 and p-H1 were considered positive. Among the 28 cases studied, the overall positive rates for XIAP, p-H1, and p63 were 60.7%, 96.4%, and 92.8%, respectively. The staining intensity for XIAP: + 70.6%, ++ 23.5%, +++ 0%, and ++++ 5.9%; for p-H1: + 48.1%, ++ 11.1%, +++37.0%, and ++++ 3.7%; and for p63: + 11.5%, ++ 23.1%, +++ 53.9%, and ++++ 11.5%. The expression of p-H1 and p63 appeared to be higher and stronger than that of XIAP in HNSCC. This study demonstrated the feasibility of monitoring expression of three tumor markers using FNA samples. p-H1 and XIAP may be useful for monitoring actions of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, XIAP-lowering, and/or apoptosis-inducing drugs, respectively. Future studies will focus on the impact of therapies upon these staining profiles.
