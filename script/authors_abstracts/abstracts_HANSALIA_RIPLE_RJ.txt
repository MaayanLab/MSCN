The inoperable valvular heart disease patient:the pluses and minuses of percutaneous valvular replacement.
The spectrum of potentially successful treatment options for inoperable valvular disease is limited. Aortic valvuloplasty may offer temporary improvement in symptoms and some survival benefit in select non-surgical patients with aortic stenosis, but it does not improve long-term outcome. Mitral valve incompetence often responds well to surgical repair, though patients with significantly reduced left ventricular function have worsened outcomes. The design of a percutaneous implantable prosthetic heart valve is a promising alternative to valvuloplasty. Although not yet an established interventional method, Percutaneous Aortic Valve Replacement (PAVR) will likely take a position among the innovative catheter-based techniques currently in development. The appropriate clinical scenario for Percutaneous Mitral Valve Intervention (PMVI), however, may be significantly narrower. As with many other minimally invasive operations or procedures, the ethical considerations of a novel approach must be considered.
