Microvascular free tissue transfer in the reconstruction of scalp and lateral temporal bone defects.
: Defects of the scalp and lateral temporal bone (LTB) represent a unique challenge to the reconstructive surgeon. Simple reconstructive methods such as skin grafts, locoregional flaps, or tissue expanders are often not feasible owing to a myriad of reasons. Vascularized free tissue transfer coverage offers distinct advantages in managing these defects. : A retrospective case series was performed on all patients at the University of Washington Medical Center who had scalp or LTB defects reconstructed with free tissue transfer from May 1996 to July 2009. Cases were analyzed for defect characteristics, flap type, vessel selection, radiation status, dural exposure, complications, and outcomes. : A total of 68 free flap reconstructions were performed in 65 patients with scalp or LTB defects. A total of 22 resections included craniotomy, and 48 patients had preoperative or postoperative radiation. Defects ranged from 6 to 836 cm. All flaps (46 latissimus, 11 rectus, 4 radial forearm, 6 anterolateral thigh, and 1 omental) were transferred successfully. Vein grafts were required in 5 cases. Complications included delayed flap failure requiring secondary reconstruction, neck hematoma, venous thrombosis, skull base infection, large wound dehiscence, small wound dehiscence, donor site hematoma and seroma, and cerebrospinal fluid leak. Cosmetic results were consistent and durable. : Microvascular free tissue transfer is a safe and reliable method of reconstructing scalp and LTB defects while offering favorable cosmetic results. We favor the use of latissimus muscle-only flap with skin graft coverage for large scalp defects and rectus or anterolateral thigh free flaps for lateral temporal bone defects.

Brachial plexus neuropathy resulting from a massively enlarged papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Well-known complications of thyroid enlargement and papillary carcinoma include compression or invasion of the trachea, esophagus, and/or vascular structures. Recurrent laryngeal nerve invasion by thyroid carcinoma is not uncommon, and phrenic nerve invasion has also been described. Preoperative dysfunction of a vocal cord, which often implies invasive carcinoma, may necessitate recurrent laryngeal nerve sacrifice and is therefore rreversible. We present an unusual case of reversible brachial plexus compression in a patient with massive thyroid enlargement and papillary carcinoma.

Adjuvant radiotherapy and survival for patients with node-positive head and neck cancer: an analysis by primary site and nodal stage.
Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) is frequently recommended for node-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with primary surgery. The impact of RT on survival for various subgroups of node-positive HNSCC has not been clearly demonstrated. Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Database, we identified 5297 patients with node-positive (N1 to N3) HNSCC treated with definitive surgery with or without adjuvant RT between 1988 and 2001. The median follow-up was 4.4 years. Adjuvant RT significantly improved 5-year overall survival (46.3%: 95% confidence interval [CI], 44.7-48.0% for surgery + RT, vs. 35.2%: 95% CI, 32.0-38.5% for surgery alone, p < 0.001) and cancer-specific survival (54.8%: 95% CI, 53.2-56.4% for surgery + RT, vs. 46.2% for surgery alone 95% CI, 42.4-50.0%, p < 0.05). Use of adjuvant RT remained a significant predictor of survival on multivariable analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% CI, 0.68-0.83; p < 0.001). Subset analyses demonstrated that adjuvant RT was associated with significantly improved survival for N1 (HR, 0.78; 95% CI; 0.67-0.90; p = 0.001), N2a (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67-0.99, p = 0.048) and N2b to N3 nodal disease (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.51-0.75; p < 0.001). Adjuvant RT increased overall survival for node-positive patients with oropharynx (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57-0.90; p = 0.004), hypopharynx (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.88; p = 0.004), larynx (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52-0.84; p = 0.001), and oral cavity (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73-0.98; p = 0.025) primary tumors. In a large population-based analysis, adjuvant RT significantly improves overall survival for patients with node-positive HNSCC. All nodal stages, including N1, appear to benefit from the addition of RT to definitive surgery.
