Cardiovascular risk and memory in non-demented elderly women.
To determine whether cardiovascular (CV) risk is associated with subtle memory deficits in non-demented, healthy older women with a family history of Alzheimer disease (AD). Baseline data of 375 participants from a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled primary prevention trial to test the efficacy of hormone replacement therapy in delaying AD and cognitive decline were analyzed. All subjects were women over 65 with a family history of AD who had normal cognition and no active heart disease at baseline. A baseline memory composite score was calculated, consisting of immediate and delayed recall of verbal and nonverbal material. Multiple linear regression was performed to examine the association of relative CV risk with memory functioning; age, ethnicity and education level were included as covariates. Mean baseline memory composite score was significantly higher in those with low relative CHD risk than those with high relative CHD risk. These findings suggest that subtle elevation of CHD risk may negatively affect memory functioning even in otherwise healthy, non-demented older women without a history of heart disease.

Mirtazapine in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy associated with polycythemia vera.
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a usually fatal cerebral white matter disease found in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and other immunocompromised states. We present the case of a 63-year-old woman with polycythemia vera who developed a progressive focal neurological deficit with white matter abnormalities on magnetic resonance images of the brain that was proved on biopsy to be PML. She was treated with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor mirtazapine and remains neurologically stable, with resolution of cerebral lesions, >2 years after diagnosis. We propose that mirtazapine should be investigated further for use in PML.
