Enhanced detection of diffusion reductions in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease at a higher B factor.
Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is sensitive to the cerebral manifestations of human prion diseases. The magnitude of diffusion weighting, termed "b factor," has only been evaluated at the standard b = 1000 s/mm(2). This is the first rigorous evaluation of b = 2000 s/mm(2) in Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). We compared DWI characteristics of 13 patients with CJD and 15 healthy controls at b = 1000 s/mm(2) and b = 2000 s/mm(2). Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were computed and analyzed for the whole brain by voxel-wise analysis (by SPM5) as well as in anatomically defined volumes of interest (by FSL FIRST). Measured ADC was significantly lower (by approximately 5%-15%) at b = 2000 s/mm(2) than at b = 1000 s/mm(2) and significantly lower in patients than in controls. The differences between patients and controls were greater and more extensive at b = 2000 s/mm(2) than at b = 1000 s/mm(2) in the expected regions (thalamus, putamen, and caudate nucleus). Because higher b factors change the absolute value of observed ADC, as well as lesion detection, care should be taken when combining studies using different b factors. While the clinical application of high b factors is currently limited by a low signal intensity-to-noise ratio, it may offer more information in questionable cases, and our results confirm and extend the central role of diffusion imaging in human prion diseases.
