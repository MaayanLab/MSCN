National trend in prevalence, cost, and discharge disposition after subdural hematoma from 1998-2007.
OBJECTIVES:: Subdural hematoma is a common type of intracranial hemorrhage, particularly among the elderly, yet, despite the aging US population, little has been published in the last 10 yrs. This study aimed to determine national trends in prevalence, discharge disposition, length of stay, and cost of subdural hematoma over time. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:: Retrospective cohort study of 720,297 adult patients hospitalized in the United States with subdural hematoma between 1998 and 2007 identified in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. INTERVENTIONS:: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: Discharge disposition, hospital length of stay, and national cost (adjusted to 2007 dollars) were examined. Hospitalizations for subdural hematoma increased from 59,373 (30 per 100,000 hospitalizations) in 1998 to 91,935 (42 per 100,000) in 2007, constituting a 39% per-capita increase. The prevalence of subdural hematoma increased with age (p < .001), particularly among those >80 yrs of age (36% of subdural hematoma cohort), in lower income patients, in patients with acquired abnormalities of the coagulation cascade, and in patients with trauma. Inhospital mortality decreased from 15% to 12% (p = .001), but unsatisfactory discharge disposition increased from 17% to 20% (p < .001). National cost increased from $1.0 to $1.6 billion (p < .001). Unsatisfactory discharge disposition and cost were both independently predicted by higher comorbidity index, alcohol abuse, history of trauma, and acquired abnormal coagulation or platelet factors (p < .05). Neurosurgical intervention for subdural hematoma decreased from 41% in 1998 to 31% in 2007 (p < .001). Subdural hematoma evacuation was associated with decreased mortality but did not significantly protect against poor discharge disposition and was associated with significantly higher cost. CONCLUSIONS:: The prevalence and total cost for subdural hematoma has increased significantly in the last decade nationwide. Health resource consumption for subdural hematoma is increasing without clear evidence that management practices are leading to improved outcomes.

Delirium and sedation in the ICU.
Delirium is defined by a fluctuating level of attentiveness and has been associated with increased ICU mortality and poor cognitive outcomes in both general ICU and neurocritical care populations. Sedation use in the ICU can contribute to delirium. Limiting ICU sedation allows for the diagnosis of underlying acute neurological insults associated with delirium and leads to shorter mechanical ventilation time, shorter length of stay, and improved 1 year mortality rates. Identifying the underlying etiology of delirium is critical to developing treatment paradigms.

Recurrent vasospasm after endovascular treatment in subarachnoid hemorrhage.
the frequency and predictors of recurrent symptomatic and angiographic vasospasm after angioplasty or intra-arterial chemical vasodilatation (IACV) in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are not well characterized. a retrospective review of serial clinical and angiographic data was conducted between 7/2001-6/2008 on spontaneous SAH patients who underwent endovascular therapy for symptomatic vasospasm. of 318 SAH patients, symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 80 (25%) and endovascular intervention was performed on 69 (22%) patients. Of these 69 patients, all received IACV in 274 vessels and 33 also underwent angioplasty in a total of 76 vessels. Recurrent angiographic vasospasm occurred in the same vessel segment in 9/23 (39%) patients who received both angioplasty + IACV compared to 40/49 (82%) of patients who received IACV alone (P < 0.001). Recurrent symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 10/26 (38%) angioplasty + IACV patients compared to 28/37 (76%) patients who received IACV alone (P = 0.003). The modified-Fisher Score, A1 spasm, distal and multi-vessel vasospasm predicted recurrent angiographic spasm after IACV alone (P < 0.05). Procedural complications occurred in 4% of IACV alone patients and 6% of angioplasty + IACV patients (P = 0.599). recurrent angiographic or symptomatic vasospasm is not uncommon after angioplasty + IACV, but appears to occur significantly less than after IACV alone, without any increase in procedural complications.

Neurological management of fulminant hepatic failure.
Acute liver failure (ALF) is uncommon in the United States, but presents acutely and catastrophically, often with deadly consequences. Hepatic encephalopathy, cerebral edema, elevated intracranial pressure, and intracranial hemorrhage due to coagulopathy are common occurrences in patients with ALF. Appropriate management of multi-system organ failure and neurological complications are essential in bridging patients to transplant and ensuring satisfactory outcomes.

Trend in outcome and financial impact of subdural hemorrhage.
Little current data exists regarding outcome, cost, and length of stay (LOS) after subdural hemorrhage (SDH). We sought to examine predictors of discharge disposition, ICU and hospital LOS and direct, indirect, ICU, surgical, and diagnostic costs for SDH. A retrospective review was conducted of 216 SDH patients, aged >18 years admitted to our hospital between 1/2001 and 12/2008. Discharge disposition was characterized as dead, poor or good. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of disposition, LOS, and cost. Of 216 SDH patients, the median age was 74 (19-95), and the median admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 14 (3-15). The SDH was characterized as acute in 14%, subacute in 44%, chronic in 12%, and mixed in 30%. Surgical evacuation was performed in 139 (64%) patients. Death occurred in 29 (13%) patients and poor disposition in 43 (20%). Significant predictors of death included age, admission GCS, and hospital LOS (P < 0.05). Longer hospital LOS was associated with poor disposition, while shorter ICU LOS was associated with good disposition (P < 0.01). Median hospital LOS was 8 (1-99) days. Median total direct costs for hospitalization were $10,670 ($907-238,856). ICU and hospital LOS were significant predictors of all measures of cost (P < 0.05). SDH size, chronicity, and surgical intervention were not predictors of any outcome. There was no significant change in any outcome variable between 2001 and 2008. Despite good admission neurological status, death or poor discharge disposition is common after SDH. LOS and costs remain high and have not improved in the last decade.

Clinical response to hypertensive hypervolemic therapy and outcome after subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Hypertensive hypervolemic therapy is widely used to treat symptomatic vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Few data exist to support a relationship between early clinical response and mortality or functional outcome. In a prospective cohort of 580 subarachnoid hemorrhage patients, we studied 95 patients with acute symptomatic vasospasm who received stepwise volume expansion with crystalloid and/or 5% albumin solution followed by intravenous pressors to maintain systolic blood pressure between 180 and 220 mm Hg. We separately assessed the effects of volume expansion and induced hypertension on the neurological examination during the first 2 hours of each intervention. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to calculate adjusted odds ratios assessing the relationship between clinical response to hypertensive hypervolemic therapy and 3-month outcome, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale. Of 95 patients with symptomatic vasospasm, volume expansion was used in 94% (n = 89), of whom 43% had a clinical response; 85% of the patients (n = 81) received pressors, of whom 68% responded. Early clinical improvement attributable to either volume expansion or pressors was not related to the development of infarction on computed tomography, but response to either modality within 2 hours was independently protective against death (adjusted odds ratio, 0.03; P < 0.05) and death-or-severe-disability (modified Rankin Scale score, 4-6; adjusted odds ratio, 0.1; P < 0.05) after adjusting for age, Hunt-Hess grade, angioplasty, and aneurysm size. Subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with symptomatic vasospasm who fail to demonstrate early clinical improvement in response to volume or pressor therapy are at high risk for death or disability. Urgent endovascular intervention in this high-risk patient cohort may be justified.

How I manage the adult potential organ donor: donation after cardiac death (part 2).
To address the gap between organs available for transplant and the number of patients on the transplant waiting list, the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, Institute of Medicine, United Network for Organ Sharing and the federal government have recommended the increased used of donation after cardiac death (DCD) (JCAHOnline http://www.jointcommission.org/Library/JCAHOnline/jo_06.06.htm ; UNOS, Highlights of the June Board Meeting, 2006). DCD is defined as organ donation once death is declared after irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions, as opposed to brain death (donation after neurological death). Though DCD is one of the fastest growing categories of organ donors, it comprises only 8% of all deceased donors (Steinbrook in N Engl J Med 357:209-213, 2007). Prior to 1968, when the Ad Hoc Committee of Harvard Medical School proposed a neurological definition of death based on brain-death criteria, organs from deceased donors came from patients who had suffered cardio-pulmonary demise (IOM, Non-heart-beating organ transplantation: practice and protocols, 2000). Early transplantation from DCD donors met with limited success and most transplant surgeons turned to brain-dead donors. Consequently, DCD fell out of vogue and, until recently, has not been the focus of transplant initiatives.

How I manage the adult potential organ donor: donation after neurological death (part 1).
The need for organ donation has become a growing concern over that last decade as the gap between organ donors and those awaiting transplant widens. According to UNOS, as of 8/2009, there were 102,962 patients on the transplant waiting list and only 6,004 donors in 2009 (UNOS.org. Accessed 4/8/2009). In 2008, an estimated 17 patients died each day awaiting transplant (OPTN.org). Though currently most organ donations come after brain death (DND or donation after neurological death), tissue donation (cornea, skin, bone, and musculoskeletal tissue), and donation after cardiac death (DCD) and are also possible. The term "extended criteria donor" refers to potential donors over 60 years of age or age 50-59 years plus 2 of the 3 following criteria: stroke as the cause of death, creatnine > 1.5 meq/dl, or a history of hypertension. Historically, extended criteria donors have had a lower organ yield per donor. In order to preserve the choice of organ donation for the family, intensive management of the potential organ donor is necessary. Since each potential donor could save seven lives or more, nihilism in the care of such patients can have far reaching ramifications. This article describes intensive care management practices that can optimize organ donation.

Defining vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage: what is the most clinically relevant definition?
Vasospasm is an important complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage, but is variably defined in the literature. We studied 580 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and identified those with: (1) symptomatic vasospasm, defined as clinical deterioration deemed secondary to vasospasm after other causes were eliminated; (2) delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), defined as symptomatic vasospasm, or infarction on CT attributable to vasospasm; (3) angiographic spasm, as seen on digital subtraction angiography; and (4) transcranial Doppler (TCD) spasm, defined as any mean flow velocity >120 cm/sec. Logistic regression analysis was performed to test the association of each definition of vasospasm with various hospital complications, and 3-month quality of life (sickness impact profile), cognitive status (telephone interview of cognitive status), instrumental activities of daily living (Lawton score), and death or severe disability at 3 months (modified Rankin scale score 4-6), after adjustment for covariates. Symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 16%, DCI in 21%, angiographic vasospasm in 31%, and TCD spasm in 45% of patients. DCI was statistically associated with more hospital complications (N=7; all P<0.05) than symptomatic spasm (N=4), angiographic spasm (N=1), or TCD vasospasm (N=1). Angiographic and TCD vasospasm were not related to any aspect of clinical outcome. Both symptomatic vasospasm and DCI were related to reduced instrumental activities of daily living, cognitive impairment, and poor quality of life (all P<0.05). However, only DCI was associated with death or severe disability at 3 months (adjusted OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-3.9; P=0.007). DCI is a more clinically meaningful definition than either symptomatic deterioration alone or the presence of arterial spasm by angiography or TCD.

Cardiac arrhythmias after subarachnoid hemorrhage: risk factors and impact on outcome.
Serious cardiac arrhythmias have been described in approximately 5% of patients after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The aim of this study was to identify the frequency, risk factors and clinical impact of cardiac arrhythmia after SAH. We prospectively studied 580 spontaneous SAH patients and identified risk factors and complications associated with the development of clinically significant arrhythmia. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios for the effect of arrhythmia on hospital complications and 3-month outcome, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale, after controlling for age, neurological grade, APACHE-2 physiologic subscore, brain herniation and aneurysm size. Arrhythmia occurred in 4.3% (n = 25) of patients. Atrial fibrillation and flutter were the most common arrhythmias, occurring in 76% (n = 19) of these patients. Admission predictors of cardiac arrhythmia included older age, history of arrhythmia and abnormal admission electrocardiogram (all p < 0.05). After adjusting for length of stay, hospital complications associated with arrhythmia included myocardial ischemia, hyperglycemia, and herniation (all p < 0.05). Arrhythmia was associated with an excess ICU stay of 5 days (p = 0.002). After adjusting for other predictors of outcome, arrhythmia was associated with an increased risk of death (adjusted OR 8.0, 95% confidence interval 1.9-34.0, p = 0.005), and death or severe disability (adjusted OR 6.9, 95% confidence interval 1.5-32.0, p = 0.014). Clinically important arrhythmias, most often atrial fibrillation or flutter, occurred in 4% of SAH patients. Arrhythmias are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular comorbidity, prolonged hospital stay and poor outcome or death after SAH, after adjusting for other predictors of poor outcome.

Impact of nosocomial infectious complications after subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Critically ill neurological patients are susceptible to infections that may be distinct from other intensive care patients. The aim of this study is to quantify the prevalence, risk factors, and effect on the outcome of nosocomial infectious complications in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We studied 573 consecutive patients with SAH, identified the most prevalent infectious complications, and performed univariate analyses to determine risk factors for each complication. Multiple logistic regression models were constructed to calculate adjusted odds ratios for associated risk factors and to assess the impact of infectious complications on 3-month outcome as evaluated with the modified Rankin Scale. The most prevalent nosocomial infections were pneumonia (n = 114, 20%), urinary tract infection (n = 77, 13%), bloodstream infection (BSI) (n = 48, 8%), and meningitis/ventriculitis (n = 28, 5%). Significant independent associations with pneumonia included older age, poor Hunt and Hess grade, intubation/mechanical ventilation, and loss of consciousness at ictus. Urinary tract infection was associated with female sex and central line use. BSI was also associated with central line use, and meningitis/ventriculitis was associated with the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage and external ventricular drainage (all P < 0.05). After adjustment for Hunt and Hess grade, aneurysm size, and age, pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.71; P = 0.020) and BSI (adjusted odds ratio, 2.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-5.56; P = 0.023) independently predicted death or severe disability at 3 months. Prolonged length of stay was significantly associated with all infection types (P < 0.001). Pneumonia and BSI are common infectious complications of SAH and independently predict poor outcome. The implementation of infection-control measures may be needed to improve outcome after SAH.
