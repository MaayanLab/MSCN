Mutations in a Helix-1 Motif of the ATP Synthase c-Subunit of Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 Cause Functional Deficits and Changes in the c-Ring Stability and Mobility on Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis.
The ATP synthase of the alkaliphile Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 has a tridecameric c-subunit rotor ring. Each c-subunit has an AxAxAxA motif near the center of the inner helix, where neutralophilic bacteria generally have a GxGxGxG motif. Here, we studied the impact of four single and six multiple Ala-to-Gly chromosomal mutations in the A16xAxAxA22 motif on the capacity for nonfermentative growth and, for most of the mutants, on ATP synthesis by ADP- and P(i)-loaded membrane vesicles at pH 7.5 and 10.5. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analyses of the holo-ATP synthases were used to probe stability of the mutant c-rotors and mobility properties of the c-rotors as well as the monomeric c-subunits that are released from them by trichloroacetic acid treatment. Mutants containing an Ala16-to-Gly mutation exhibited the most severe functional defects. Via SDS-PAGE, most of the mutant c-monomers exhibited increased mobility relative to the wild-type (WT) c-subunit, but among the intact c-rings, only Ala16-to-Gly mutants exhibited significantly increased mobility relative to that of the WT c-ring. The hypothesis that these c-rings have a decreased c-subunit stoichiometry is still untested, but the functional impact of an Ala16-to-Gly mutation clearly depended upon additional Ala-to-Gly mutation(s) and their positions. The A16/20G double mutant exhibited a larger functional deficit than both the A16G and A16/18G mutants. Most of the mutant c-rings showed in vitro instability relative to that of the WT c-ring. However, the functional deficits of mutants did not correlate well with the extent of c-ring stability loss, so this property is unlikely to be a major factor in vivo.

The ATP synthase a-subunit of extreme alkaliphiles is a distinct variant: mutations in the critical alkaliphile-specific residue Lys-180 and other residues that support alkaliphile oxidative phosphorylation.
A lysine residue in the putative proton uptake pathway of the ATP synthase a-subunit is found only in alkaliphilic Bacillus species and is proposed to play roles in proton capture, retention and passage to the synthase rotor. Here, Lys-180 was replaced with alanine (Ala), glycine (Gly), cysteine (Cys), arginine (Arg), or histidine (His) in the chromosome of alkaliphilic Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4. All mutants exhibited octylglucoside-stimulated ATPase activity and ?-subunit levels at least as high as wild-type. Purified mutant F(1)F(0)-ATP synthases all contained substantial a-subunit levels. The mutants exhibited diverse patterns of native (no octylglucoside) ATPase activity and a range of defects in malate growth and in vitro ATP synthesis at pH 10.5. ATP synthesis by the Ala, Gly, and His mutants was also impaired at pH 7.5 in the presence of a protonophoric uncoupler. Thus Lys-180 plays a role when the protonmotive force is reduced at near neutral, not just at high pH. The Arg mutant exhibited no ATP synthesis activity in the alkaliphile setting although activity was reported for a K180R mutant of a thermoalkaliphile synthase (McMillan, D. G., Keis, S., Dimroth, P., and Cook, G. M. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 17395-17404). The hypothesis that a-subunits from extreme alkaliphiles and the thermoalkaliphile represent distinct variants was supported by demonstration of the importance of additional alkaliphile-specific a-subunit residues, not found in the thermoalkaliphile, for malate growth of B. pseudofirmus OF4. Finally, a mutant B. pseudofirmus OF4 synthase with switched positions of Lys-180 (helix 4) and Gly-212 (helix 5) retained significant coupled synthase activity accompanied by proton leakiness.

F1F0-ATP synthases of alkaliphilic bacteria: lessons from their adaptations.
This review focuses on the ATP synthases of alkaliphilic bacteria and, in particular, those that successfully overcome the bioenergetic challenges of achieving robust H+-coupled ATP synthesis at external pH values>10. At such pH values the protonmotive force, which is posited to provide the energetic driving force for ATP synthesis, is too low to account for the ATP synthesis observed. The protonmotive force is lowered at a very high pH by the need to maintain a cytoplasmic pH well below the pH outside, which results in an energetically adverse pH gradient. Several anticipated solutions to this bioenergetic conundrum have been ruled out. Although the transmembrane sodium motive force is high under alkaline conditions, respiratory alkaliphilic bacteria do not use Na+- instead of H+-coupled ATP synthases. Nor do they offset the adverse pH gradient with a compensatory increase in the transmembrane electrical potential component of the protonmotive force. Moreover, studies of ATP synthase rotors indicate that alkaliphiles cannot fully resolve the energetic problem by using an ATP synthase with a large number of c-subunits in the synthase rotor ring. Increased attention now focuses on delocalized gradients near the membrane surface and H+ transfers to ATP synthases via membrane-associated microcircuits between the H+ pumping complexes and synthases. Microcircuits likely depend upon proximity of pumps and synthases, specific membrane properties and specific adaptations of the participating enzyme complexes. ATP synthesis in alkaliphiles depends upon alkaliphile-specific adaptations of the ATP synthase and there is also evidence for alkaliphile-specific adaptations of respiratory chain components.

Cation/proton antiporter complements of bacteria: why so large and diverse?
Most bacterial genomes have five to nine distinct genes predicted to encode transporters that exchange cytoplasmic Na(+) and/or K(+) for H(+) from outside the cell, i.e. monovalent cation/proton antiporters. By contrast, pathogens that live primarily inside host cells usually possess zero to one such antiporter while other stress-exposed bacteria exhibit even higher numbers. The monovalent cation/proton antiporters encoded by these diverse genes fall into at least eight different transporter protein families based on sequence similarity. They enable bacteria to meet challenges of high or fluctuating pH, salt, temperature or osmolarity, but we lack explanations for why so many antiporters are needed and for the value added by specific antiporter types in specific settings. In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, analyses of the pH dependence of cytoplasmic [Na(+)], [K(+)], pH and transmembrane electrical potential in the 'poly extremophile'Natranaerobius thermophilus are the context for assessment of the catalytic properties of 12 predicted monovalent cation/proton antiporters in the genome of this thermophilic haloalkaliphile. The results provide a profile of adaptations of the poly extremophilic anaerobe, including a proposed role of cytoplasmic buffering capacity. They also provide new perspectives on two large monovalent cation/proton antiporter families, the NhaC and the cation/proton antiporter-3 antiporter families.

Characterization of the Functionally Critical AXAXAXA and PXXEXXP Motifs of the ATP Synthase c-Subunit from an Alkaliphilic Bacillus.
The membrane-embedded rotor in the F(0) sector of proton-translocating ATP synthases is formed from hairpin-like c-subunits that are protonated and deprotonated during energization of ATP synthesis. This study focuses on two c-subunit motifs that are unique to synthases of extremely alkaliphilic Bacillus species. One motif is the AXAXAXA sequence found in the N-terminal helix-1 instead of the GXGXGXG of non-alkaliphiles. Quadruple A-->G chromosomal mutants of alkaliphilic Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 retain 50% of the wild-type hydrolytic activity (ATPase) but <18% of the ATP synthase capacity at high pH. Consistent with a structural impact of the four alanine replacements, the mutant ATPase activity showed enhanced inhibition by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, which blocks the helix-2 carboxylate. Single, double, or triple A-->G mutants exhibited more modest defects, as monitored by malate growth. The key carboxylate is in the second motif, which is P(51)XXE(54)XXP in extreme alkaliphiles instead of the (A/G)XX(E/D)XXP found elsewhere. Mutation of Pro(51) to alanine had been shown to severely reduce malate growth and ATP synthesis at high pH. Here, two Pro(51) to glycine mutants of different severities retained ATP synthase capacity but exhibited growth deficits and proton leakiness. A Glu(54) to Asp(54) change increased proton leakiness and reduced malate growth 79-90%. The Pro(51) and the Glu(54) mutants were both more dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-sensitive than wild type. The results highlight the requirement for c-subunit adaptations to achieve alkaliphile ATP synthesis with minimal cytoplasmic proton loss and suggest partial suppression of some mutations by changes outside the atp operon.

Purification of two putative type II NADH dehydrogenases with different substrate specificities from alkaliphilic Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4.
A putative Type II NADH dehydrogenase from Halobacillus dabanensis was recently reported to have Na+/H+ antiport activity (and called Nap), raising the possibility of direct coupling of respiration to antiport-dependent pH homeostasis. This study characterized a homologous type II NADH dehydrogenase of genetically tractable alkaliphilic Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4, in which evidence supports antiport-based pH homeostasis that is mediated entirely by secondary antiport. Two candidate type II NADH dehydrogenase genes with canonical GXGXXG motifs were identified in a draft genome sequence of B. pseudofirmus OF4. The gene product designated NDH-2A exhibited homology to enzymes from Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli whereas NDH-2B exhibited homology to the H. dabanensis Nap protein and its alkaliphilic Bacillus halodurans C-125 homologue. The ndh-2A, but not the ndh-2B, gene complemented the growth defect of an NADH dehydrogenase-deficient E. coli mutant. Neither gene conferred Na+-resistance on an antiporter-deficient E. coli strain, nor did they confer Na+/H+ antiport activity in vesicle assays. The purified hexa-histidine-tagged gene products were approximately 50 kDa, contained noncovalently bound FAD and oxidized NADH. They were predominantly cytoplasmic in E. coli, consonant with the absence of antiport activity. The catalytic properties of NDH-2A were more consistent with a major respiratory role than those of NDH-2B.

Catalytic properties of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus members of the secondary cation/proton antiporter-3 (Mrp) family are revealed by an optimized assay in an Escherichia coli host.
Monovalent cation proton antiporter-3 (Mrp) family antiporters are widely distributed and physiologically important in prokaryotes. Unlike other antiporters, they require six or seven hydrophobic gene products for full activity. Standard fluorescence-based assays of Mrp antiport in membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli transformants have not yielded strong enough signals for characterization of antiport kinetics. Here, an optimized assay protocol for vesicles of antiporter-deficient E. coli EP432 transformants produced higher levels of secondary Na(+)(Li(+))/H(+) antiport than previously reported. Assays were conducted on Mrps from alkaliphilic Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 and Bacillus subtilis and the homologous antiporter of Staphylococcus aureus (Mnh), all of which exhibited Na(+)(Li(+))/H(+) antiport. A second paralogue of S. aureus (Mnh2) did not. K(+), Ca(2+), and Mg(2+) did not support significant antiport by any of the test antiporters. All three Na(+)(Li(+))/H(+) Mrp antiporters had alkaline pH optima and apparent K(m) values for Na(+) that are among the lowest reported for bacterial Na(+)/H(+) antiporters. Using a fluorescent probe of the transmembrane electrical potential (DeltaPsi), Mrp Na(+)/H(+) antiport was shown to be DeltaPsi consuming, from which it is inferred to be electrogenic. These assays also showed that membranes from E. coli EP432 expressing Mrp antiporters generated higher DeltaPsi levels than control membranes, as did membranes from E. coli EP432 expressing plasmid-borne NhaA, the well-characterized electrogenic E. coli antiporter. Assays of respiratory chain components in membranes from Mrp and control E. coli transformants led to a hypothesis explaining how activity of secondary, DeltaPsi-consuming antiporters can elicit increased capacity for DeltaPsi generation in a bacterial host.
