An analytical approach to clinical forensic evaluations of asylum seekers: the Healthright International Human Rights Clinic.
Healthright International, formerly Doctors of the World-USA, has for the past 15years trained clinicians to perform forensic medical evaluations of torture survivors. As the burden of proof in asylum cases in the United States has increased, so has the scrutinizing of the evidence presented. We present a series of cases in which the scars themselves bear testimony to the applicant's case, bolstering the importance of photography in these cases.
