Type 1 Gaucher disease: significant disease manifestations in "asymptomatic" homozygotes.
Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD), an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, is most prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population. Experts have suggested that up to two-thirds of AJ homozygotes for the common mutation (N370S) are asymptomatic throughout life and never come to medical attention. However, there are no systematic studies of N370S homozygotes to support this presumption. Prenatal carrier screening of 8069 AJ adults for 6 common GD mutations was performed. Gaucher disease manifestations in 37 previously unrecognized homozygotes were assessed by clinical, laboratory, and imaging studies. Among the 8069 AJ screenees, 524 GD carriers (1:15) and 9 previously unrecognized GD homozygotes (1:897) were identified, consistent with the rate expected (1:949; P > .99). Six of these homozygotes and 31 AJ GD homozygotes identified by other prenatal carrier screening programs in the New York City metropolitan area were evaluated (age range of the homozygotes, 17-40 years). Of these, 84% were N370S homozygotes, others being heteroallelic for N370S and V394L, L444P, or R496H mutations. Notably, 65% reported no GD medical complaints. However, 49% had anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Among the 29 who had imaging studies, 97% had mild to moderate splenomegaly and 55% had hepatomegaly; skeletal imaging revealed marrow infiltration (100%), Erlenmeyer flask deformities (43%), lucencies (22%), and bone infarcts (14%). Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry studies of 25 homozygotes found 60% with osteopenia or osteoporosis. Contrary to previous discussions, almost all asymptomatic GD homozygotes serendipitously diagnosed by prenatal carrier screening had disease manifestations and should be followed for disease progression and institution of appropriate medical treatment.

Experience with carrier screening and prenatal diagnosis for 16 Ashkenazi Jewish genetic diseases.
The success of prenatal carrier screening as a disease prevention strategy in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population has driven the expansion of screening panels as disease-causing founder mutations have been identified. However, the carrier frequencies of many of these mutations have not been reported in large AJ cohorts. We determined the carrier frequencies of over 100 mutations for 16 recessive disorders in the New York metropolitan area AJ population. Among the 100% AJ-descended individuals, screening for 16 disorders resulted in ?1 in 3.3 being a carrier for one disease and ?1 in 24 for two diseases. The carrier frequencies ranged from 0.066 (1 in 15.2; Gaucher disease) to 0.006 (1 in 168; nemaline myopathy), which averaged ?15% higher than those for all screenees. Importantly, over 95% of screenees chose to be screened for all possible AJ diseases, including disorders with lower carrier frequencies and/or detectability. Carrier screening also identified rare individuals homozygous for disease-causing mutations who had previously unrecognized clinical manifestations. Additionally, prenatal testing results and experience for all 16 disorders (n = 574) are reported. Together, these data indicate the general acceptance, carrier frequencies, and prenatal testing results for an expanded panel of 16 diseases in the AJ population.

Combined CYP2C9, VKORC1 and CYP4F2 frequencies among racial and ethnic groups.
CYP4F2*3 (p.V433M) has been associated with higher warfarin dose requirements; however, its frequency, like other CYP2C9 and VKORC1 variants, has not been systematically assessed in major racial/ethnic populations. Thus, we determined the individual and combined frequencies of important CYP2C9, VKORC1 and CYP4F2 variants in several racial/ethnic groups. Healthy African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic and Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) blood donors were genotyped for CYP2C9 (*2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *8, *11 and *13), VKORC1 (g.-1639G>A) and CYP4F2 (*3 [p.V433M] and rs2189784). The combined frequencies of variant CYP2C9 alleles were 0.133, 0.078, 0.212, 0.178 and 0.212 among African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic and AJ individuals, respectively. CYP4F2*3 frequencies were prevalent (0.233-0.342) among Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic and AJ individuals, while significantly less frequent among African-Americans (0.117; p < 0.0001). In addition, CYP4F2*3 was in linkage disequilibrium with rs2189784, an allele recently associated with time-to-therapeutic international normalized ratio, among all studied populations. Importantly, 87-95% of Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic and AJ individuals had a variant CYP2C9, VKORC1 and/or CYP4F2*3 allele, compared with only 53% of African-Americans (p < 0.0001). Compared with other racial/ethnic populations studied, only approximately one in 80 African-Americans were CYP4F2*3 homozygous, indicating that this population would benefit less from dosing algorithms that include this variant. In addition, the unique allele frequency profiles identified among the different populations partly explain why genotype-guided warfarin dosing algorithms perform less well for African-Americans and suggest that other unidentified genetic and/or nongenetic factors that influence warfarin dosage may exist in this population.

CYP2C9*8 is prevalent among African-Americans: implications for pharmacogenetic dosing.
Although the frequencies of pharmacogenetic variants differ among racial groups, most pharmacogenetic algorithms for genotype-guided warfarin dosing only include two CYP2C9 alleles (*2 and *3) and a single VKORC1 allele (g.-1639G>A or g.1173C>T) commonly found among Caucasians. Therefore, this study sought to identify other CYP2C9 and VKORC1 alleles important in warfarin dose variability and to determine their frequencies in different racial and ethnic groups. The CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes were sequenced in selected sensitive (< 21 mg/week) and resistant (> 49 mg/week) individuals with discrepant therapeutic and algorithm-predicted warfarin doses based on prior CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotyping. The CYP2C9 and VKORC1 allele frequencies were determined in healthy, racially self-identified blood donors. Sequencing identified an African-American male with a lower than predicted therapeutic warfarin dose (14.4 mg/week), previously genotyped as CYP2C9*1/*1, who was homozygous for CYP2C9*8 (c.449G>A; p.R150H). Genotyping 600 African-American alleles identified CYP2C9*8 as their most frequent variant CYP2C9 allele (0.047), and the combined allele frequency of CYP2C9*2, *3, *5, *6, *8 and *11 was 0.133. Given most warfarin pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms only include CYP2C9*2 and *3, the inclusion of CYP2C9*8 alone could reclassify the predicted metabolic phenotypes of almost 10% of African-Americans, or when combined with CYP2C9*5, *6 and *11, more than 15%. In addition, the African-American VKORC1 g.-1639A allele frequency was 0.108 and three g.1331G>A (p.V66M) carriers were identified. CYP2C9*8 is prevalent among African-Americans ( approximately 1 in 11 individuals). Thus, in this racial group, the incorporation of CYP2C9*8 into genotyping panels may improve dose prediction of CYP2C9-metabolized drugs, including warfarin.

Warfarin pharmacogenetics: CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes predict different sensitivity and resistance frequencies in the Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jewish populations.
Warfarin is a widely used anticoagulant that has a narrow therapeutic range because of both genetic and environmental factors. CYP2C9( *)2 (p.R144C), CYP2C9( *)3 (p.I359L), and the VKORC1 promoter (g.-1639G-->A) polymorphisms occur frequently in patients who are warfarin "sensitive" and require lower doses, whereas patients with VKORC1 missense mutations are warfarin "resistant" and require higher doses. To compare the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 allele and genotype frequencies among 260 Ashkenazi (AJ) and 80 Sephardi Jewish (SJ) individuals, we genotyped six CYP2C9 and eight VKORC1 alleles by using the Tag-It Mutation Detection Kit and PCR-RFLP assays. The "sensitive"CYP2C9( *)2 and ( *)3 alleles had significantly higher frequencies in SJ than in AJ individuals, 0.194 and 0.144 versus 0.127 and 0.081, respectively (p <or= 0.001). In contrast, the VKORC1 p.D36Y mutation, which predicts warfarin "resistance," had a significantly higher frequency in AJ than in SJ individuals, 0.043 versus 0.006, respectively (p <or= 0.025). Of note, 11.3% of AJ individuals predicted to be CYP2C9 extensive metabolizers and 8.7% of those predicted to be intermediate and poor metabolizers were VKORC1 p.D36Y carriers who require markedly higher warfarin doses. Thus, approximately 10% of all AJ individuals would be misclassified when only genotyping CYP2C9( *)2, ( *)3, and VKORC1 g.-1639G-->A, underscoring the importance of screening for p.D36Y prior to initiating warfarin anticoagulation in AJ individuals. Taken together, our findings show that approximately 85% of AJ and approximately 90% of SJ individuals have at least one "sensitive" (CYP2C9( *)2, ( *)3, VKORC1 g.-1639G-->A) or "resistant" (VKORC1 p.D36Y) allele, indicating that each group has different warfarin pharmacogenetics and would benefit from genotype-based dose predictions.

CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 allele frequencies in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.
To determine and compare the cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 allele and genotype frequencies in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population with other populations. CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genotypes were determined in 250 anonymous, unrelated, healthy AJ individuals from the greater New York (USA) metropolitan area. Genotyping was performed using the Tag-Ittrade mark Mutation Detection system and the recently redefined CYP2D6*41A allele was identified by a restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Among the 250 AJ individuals, the CYP2C9*1, *2, *3 and *5 allele frequencies were 0.772, 0.140, 0.086 and 0.002, respectively, and the genotypes were distributed into extensive- (60.8%), intermediate- (32.8%) and poor- (6.4%) metabolizer phenotypes. The CYP2C19*1, *2 and *4 allele frequencies were 0.830, 0.152 and 0.018, respectively, and the genotypes were distributed into extensive (69.2%), intermediate (27.6%) and poor (3.2%) metabolizers. The most common CYP2D6 alleles identified were *1, *2A, *4 and *41A, and their frequencies were 0.286 0.152 0.226 and 0.140, respectively. The CYP2D6 genotypes were distributed into ultrarapid- (8.8%), extensive- (70.0%), intermediate- (16.0%) and poor- (5.2%) metabolizer phenotypes. Although the CYP2C9 allele and genotype frequencies in the AJ subjects were similar to those in other North American Caucasian populations, genotyping the CYP2C19*4 and CYP2D6*41A alleles in the AJ population resulted in the clinically relevant reclassification of the predicted metabolizer phenotypes. Inclusion of CYP2C19*4 reclassified individuals from either extensive- or intermediate- to the intermediate- or poor-metabolizer phenotypes, respectively. Inclusion of the redefined CYP2D6*41A allele increased the ultrarapid-, intermediate- and poor-metabolizer phenotype combined frequencies to 30%, indicating that approximately one in three AJ individuals may benefit from genotype-based drug selection and dosage. In addition, the ultrarapid CYP2D6 genotype frequency in the AJ population (8.8%) was approximately twofold higher than that in other North American Caucasians.

Identification of CYP2C19*4B: pharmacogenetic implications for drug metabolism including clopidogrel responsiveness.
CYP2C19 is a principal enzyme involved in the bioactivation of the antiplatelet prodrug clopidogrel and common CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles are associated with adverse cardiovascular events. To assess the impact of the CYP2C19*17 increased activity allele in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) and Sephardi Jewish (SJ) populations and to determine the frequencies of additional variant alleles, 250 AJ and 135 SJ individuals were genotyped for CYP2C19*2-*10, *12-*17, *22 and P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) c.3435C>T. Importantly, CYP2C19*4, a loss-of-function allele, was identified in linkage disequilibrium with *17. This novel haplotype, designated CYP2C19*4B, significantly alters the interpretation of CYP2C19 genotyping when testing *17. Moreover, genotyping CYP2C19*17 changed the frequency of extensive metabolizers from ?70 to ?40%, reclassifying ?30% as ultrarapid metabolizers. Combining CYP2C19 and ABCB1 identified ?1 in 3 AJ and ?1 in 2 SJ individuals at increased risk for adverse responses to clopidogrel. These data underscore the importance of including *4B and *17 when clinically genotyping CYP2C19.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 1 March 2011; doi:10.1038/tpj.2011.5.

PTPN11 analysis for the prenatal diagnosis of Noonan syndrome in fetuses with abnormal ultrasound findings.
Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by short stature, congenital heart defects and distinctive facies. The disorder is genetically heterogeneous with approximately 50% of patients having PTPN11 mutations. Prenatally, the diagnosis of NS has been suspected following certain ultrasound findings, such as cystic hygroma, increased nuchal translucency (NT) and hydrops fetalis. Studies of fetuses with cystic hygroma have suggested an NS prevalence of 1-3%. A retrospective review was performed to assess the utility of PTPN11 testing based on prenatal sonographic findings (n = 134). The most commonly reported indications for testing were increased NT and cystic hygroma. Analysis showed heterozygous missense mutations in 12 fetuses, corresponding to a positive test rate of 9%. PTPN11 mutations were identified in 16% and 2% of fetuses with cystic hygroma and increased NT, respectively. Among fetuses with isolated cystic hygroma, PTPN11 mutation prevalence was 11%. The mutations observed in the three fetuses with hydrops fetalis had previously been reported as somatic cancer mutations. Prenatal PTPN11 testing has diagnostic and possible prognostic properties that can aid in risk assessment and genetic counseling. As NS is genetically heterogeneous, negative PTPN11 testing cannot exclude the diagnosis and further study is warranted regarding the other NS genes.
