Safe resumption of electroconvulsive therapy after non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.
We present the case of a 69-year-old woman with psychotic depression who suffered a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction at her first electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Her course of ECT was resumed 19 days later, and she was able to complete it without further problems. Her depression remitted fully. We report the details of her cardiac management during subsequent treatment sessions and review the literature on cardiac adverse events with ECT.
