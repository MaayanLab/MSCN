Reduced isotope dose and imaging time with a high-efficiency CZT SPECT camera.
BACKGROUND: In light of recent focus on diagnostic imaging, cardiac SPECT imaging needs to become a shorter test with lower radiation exposure to patients. Recently introduced Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) cameras have the potential to achieve both goals. METHODS: During a 2-month period patients presenting for a Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT MPI study were imaged using a CZT camera using a low-dose rest-stress protocol (5 mCi rest and 15 mCi stress doses). Patients ?250 lbs or a BMI ?35 kg/m(2) were excluded. Rest images were processed at 5- and 8-minute acquisition times and stress images at 3- and 5-minute acquisition times. A subset of patients had stress imaging performed using both conventional and CZT SPECT cameras. Image acquisition times and SPECT camera images were compared based on total counts, count rate, image quality, and summed rest and stress scores. Twelve month clinical follow-up was also obtained. RESULTS: 131 patients underwent the study protocol (age 64.9 ± 9.8 years, 54.2% male). There was no significant difference in image quality and mean summed scores between 5- and 8-minute rest images and between 3- and 5-minute stress images. When compared to a conventional SPECT camera in 27 patients, total rest and stress perfusion deficits and calculated LVEF were similar (r = 0.94 and 0.96, respectively). At 12 months there was a benign prognosis in patients with normal perfusion. The effective dose was 5.8 mSv for this protocol which is 49.2% less than conventional Tc-99m studies and 75.7% less than conventional Tl-201/Tc-99m dual isotope studies. CONCLUSIONS: New SPECT camera technology with low isotope dose significantly reduces ionizing radiation exposure and imaging times compared to traditional protocols while maintaining image quality and diagnostic accuracy.

Reduced isotope dose with rapid SPECT MPI imaging: initial experience with a CZT SPECT camera.
Cardiac SPECT imaging needs to become shorter and use lower radiation doses to compete with other available noninvasive imaging modalities. Recently introduced cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) SPECT cameras have the potential to achieve both goals, but clinical experience is so far limited. Images of all patients undergoing a stress MPI over a 4-month period using a CZT camera (Discovery NM 530c) were reviewed. Patients were divided into three groups based on imaging protocols: low-dose stress-only, high-dose stress-only, and standard dose rest-stress. Low-dose stress-only patients were matched by gender, stressor, and BMI to high-dose stress-only and rest-stress subjects. Stress image quality was graded on a four-point scale by readers blinded to the imaging protocol. Demographics, tracer dose, stress imaging time, and total counts were recorded. Of 717 patients imaged, the mean age was 64.0 years, 50.5% were female, 58.9% underwent exercise stress, and the average BMI was 27.9 kg/m(2). A total of 103 low-dose stress-only patients were matched to controls. Imaging for 5 minutes in low-dose stress-only patients and for 3 minutes in high-dose stress-only and rest-stress patients, resulted in a similar number of total counts. This produced similar image quality in the three groups with a 57% isotope dose reduction in the low-dose stress-only compared to the high-dose stress-only group. New SPECT CZT camera technology allows significantly reduced radiation exposure and acquisition time without loss of image quality.

The prognosis of a normal stress-only Tc-99m myocardial perfusion imaging study.
Stress-only imaging saves time and radiation exposure, but apprehension remains about the reliability, diagnostic, and prognostic accuracy of a normal stress-only study. The objective of this study was to determine the prognosis of stress-only SPECT MPI in routine clinical practice. Patients at lower pre-test risk for CAD presenting for a Tc-99m SPECT MPI over a 2-year period underwent a stress-only protocol. If the stress images were normal (attenuation correction was routinely acquired on all patients), rest imaging was not done. Outcomes of the stress-only group were compared to a full rest-stress protocol cohort. Only patients with normal perfusion and left ventricular function, and no known CAD, were included. All-cause mortality was determined using the Social Security Death Index and specific causes of death were determined using the National Death Index. The difference in all-cause and cardiac mortality between groups in the presence of competing risks was assessed using log-normal survival models. Out of 10,609 patients studied during the time period, 1,673 had a normal stress-only study and 3,237 had a normal rest-stress study. At one year, there were 20 total and 3 cardiac deaths (1.2% and 0.2% mortality) in the stress-only group, and 40 total and 4 cardiac deaths (1.2% and 0.1% mortality) in the rest-stress cohort. At the end of follow-up (40 +/- 9 months), there were 46 total and 7 cardiac deaths (2.7% and 0.4% mortality) in the stress-only group, and 119 total and 17 cardiac deaths (3.7% and 0.5% mortality) in the rest-stress cohort. No significant difference between the stress-only and rest-stress cohorts was found after controlling for confounding variables for both all-cause mortality (p = .94) and cardiac mortality (p = .82). A normal stress-only MPI has an excellent short-term prognosis (both for all-cause and cardiac mortality) comparable to that of a normal rest-stress MPI study.

Comparison of the results of aortic valve replacement with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < or =30% versus patients with ejection fraction >30%.
The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that low-ejection fraction (EF), low-gradient aortic stenosis (AS) is a predictor of major morbidity after aortic valve replacement (AVR). We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from 597 consecutive patients with AS (mean age 72 +/- 11 years) who had undergone AVR or combined AVR and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) from 1998 to 2006 (EF < or =30% in 73 [12%]). The outcome measures included hospital mortality, major complications, and long-term survival. The overall hospital mortality rate was 4% (low-EF AS 5%; low-EF AS plus CABG 8%; AS controls 4%; AS plus CABG controls 3%; p = 0.42). Low-EF, low-gradient AS was not an independent risk factor for hospital mortality but predicted stroke (odds ratio [OR] 4.3), deep sternal wound infection (OR 10.0), sepsis (OR 6.8), gastrointestinal complications (OR 4.2), and respiratory failure (OR 4.4). The survival rate at 1, 3, and 5 years was 69 +/- 8%, 69 +/- 8%, and 65 +/- 8% in the low-EF, low-gradient, AVR plus CABG group and 95 +/- 4%, 92 +/- 5%, and 82 +/- 7% in the low-EF, low-gradient AVR group compared to 93 +/- 2%, 88 +/- 2%, and 78 +/- 3% in the AVR plus CABG control group and 93 +/- 2%, 89 +/- 2%, and 85 +/- 3% in the AVR control group (p = 0.001), respectively. In the patients with low-EF AS who experienced major postoperative morbidity, the 1-year survival rate was significantly reduced (54 +/- 14%) compared to those who did not (95 +/- 3%, p <0.001). In conclusion, low-EF, low-gradient AS is a predictor of increased major morbidity after AVR, which nonetheless remains the treatment of choice for most patients because of the excellent early and late survival. However, patients with strong risk factors for postoperative renal and respiratory failure might derive less benefit from conventional surgical AVR.

Comparison of National Football League linemen versus nonlinemen of left ventricular mass and left atrial size.
Retired National Football League (NFL) linemen have higher cardiovascular mortality compared with nonlinemen. We examined echocardiographic characteristics of retired NFL linemen compared with nonlinemen to determine if position-dependent cardiac remodeling resulted in increased left ventricular (LV) mass and left atrial (LA) size. We performed echocardiography in 487 retired NFL football players. Demographic, medical, and professional career information was collected. Interventricular septal and posterior wall thickness, LV end diastolic diameter, and LA area were measured. Body mass index (BMI) and LV mass were calculated. Retired linemen had significantly higher LV mass (234.8 +/- 65.8 g) than nonlinemen (199.8 +/- 55.4 g, p <0.0001). LA area was higher in linemen versus nonlinemen (22.5 vs 20.1 cm(2), p <0.0001). Independent predictors of increased LV mass were BMI (p <0.003), linemen position (p <0.024), and systolic blood pressure (p <0.005). In former players with BMI <35 kg/m(2) there was a difference between linemen and nonlinemen in LV mass (219.9 +/- 44.3 vs 182.6 +/- 44.3 g, p = 0.004) and LV mass/height (114.3 +/- 23.5 vs 98.8 +/- 25.2 g/m, p = 0.005). In former players with BMI >35 kg/m(2), there was no difference. There was no difference in LA area between linemen and nonlinemen in both BMI groups. In conclusion, LV mass and LA area size were highest in retired linemen. Player BMI, position, and systolic blood pressure were significant predictors of LV mass. In retired linemen compared with retired nonlinemen, the persistence of these cardiac adaptations may contribute to the higher cardiovascular mortality seen in retired linemen.

Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in retired National Football League players.
The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health mortality study of National Football League (NFL) players concluded that retired NFL linemen have an increased risk of cardiovascular death compared with both nonlinemen and the general population. Though elevated body mass index contributed to the increased cardiac risk of linemen, it could not fully account for the mortality observed, suggesting that other unmeasured cardiovascular risk factors were involved. We performed a cross-sectional prevalence study of metabolic syndrome (MS), and its individual component criteria, in 510 retired NFL players who were recruited to multicity health screenings from February 2004 through June 2006. The International Diabetes Federation criteria were used to define MS. The MS component criteria of body mass index>30 kg/m2, reduced high-density lipoprotein, and raised fasting glucose were more prevalent in linemen compared with nonlinemen (85.4% vs 50.3%, p<0.001; 42.1% vs 32.7%, p=0.04; 60.4% vs 37.6%, p<0.001, respectively). Metabolic syndrome was more prevalent in linemen compared with nonlinemen (59.8% vs 30.1%, p<0.001). In conclusion, linemen exhibited a high prevalence of MS, almost double the prevalence of their nonlinemen counterparts. These findings may partially explain the increased risk for cardiovascular death observed in retired linemen and could have significant public health implications for preprofessional training regimens and postprofessional health maintenance.
