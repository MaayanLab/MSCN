Spinal Cord Preservation in Thoracoabdominal Aneurysm Repair.
Spinal cord injury (SCI) stands as one of the most dreadful complications of thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair. Despite the less invasive nature and recent technical advancements of endovascular aortic repair, SCI still remains a significant danger in endovascular approaches. However, as our understanding of the collateral network of spinal cord vasculature has grown, it has become evident that the incidence of paraplegia and paraparesis in conjunction with endovascular procedures can be minimized through the use of many of the same strategies that have proven successful in reducing SCI associated with open surgical repair. This article highlights important aspects of spinal cord protection, which have been derived from the authors' clinical and experimental experience.

The collateral network concept: remodeling of the arterial collateral network after experimental segmental artery sacrifice.
A comprehensive strategy to prevent paraplegia after open surgical or endovascular repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms requires a thorough understanding of the response of the collateral network to extensive segmental artery sacrifice. Ten Yorkshire pigs underwent perfusion with a low-viscosity acrylic resin. With the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, 2 animals each were perfused in the native state and immediately, 6 hours, 24 hours, and 5 days after sacrifice of all segmental arteries (T4-L5). After digestion of surrounding tissue, the vascular cast of the collateral network underwent analysis of arterial and arteriolar diameters and the density and spatial orientation of the vasculature using light and scanning electron microscopy. Within 24 hours, the diameter of the anterior spinal artery had increased significantly, and within 5 days the anterior spinal artery and the epidural arterial network had enlarged in diameter by 80% to 100% (P < .0001). By 5 days, the density of the intramuscular paraspinous vessels had increased (P < .0001), a shift of size distribution from small to larger arterioles was seen (P = .0002), and a significant realignment of arterioles parallel to the spinal cord had occurred (P = .0005). Within 5 days after segmental artery occlusion, profound anatomic alterations in the intraspinal and paraspinous arteries and arterioles occurred, providing the anatomic substrate for preservation of spinal cord blood flow via collateral pathways.

The collateral network concept: a reassessment of the anatomy of spinal cord perfusion.
Prevention of paraplegia after repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm requires understanding the anatomy and physiology of the spinal cord blood supply. Recent laboratory studies and clinical observations suggest that a robust collateral network must exist to explain preservation of spinal cord perfusion when segmental vessels are interrupted. An anatomic study was undertaken. Twelve juvenile Yorkshire pigs underwent aortic cannulation and infusion of a low-viscosity acrylic resin at physiologic pressures. After curing of the resin and digestion of all organic tissue, the anatomy of the blood supply to the spinal cord was studied grossly and with light and electron microscopy. All vascular structures at least 8 ?m in diameter were preserved. Thoracic and lumbar segmental arteries give rise not only to the anterior spinal artery but to an extensive paraspinous network feeding the erector spinae, iliopsoas, and associated muscles. The anterior spinal artery, mean diameter 134 ± 20 ?m, is connected at multiple points to repetitive circular epidural arteries with mean diameters of 150 ± 26 ?m. The capacity of the paraspinous muscular network is 25-fold the capacity of the circular epidural arterial network and anterior spinal artery combined. Extensive arterial collateralization is apparent between the intraspinal and paraspinous networks, and within each network. Only 75% of all segmental arteries provide direct anterior spinal artery-supplying branches. The anterior spinal artery is only one component of an extensive paraspinous and intraspinal collateral vascular network. This network provides an anatomic explanation of the physiological resiliency of spinal cord perfusion when segmental arteries are sacrificed during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.

Long-term outcome after aortic arch replacement with a trifurcated graft.
We describe the long-term results of aortic arch replacement using a trifurcated graft, including an assessment of survival, neurologic complications, and graft patency. A retrospective review was conducted on data from 206 consecutive patients (125 male; median age, 67 years; range, 20-87 years) who had a trifurcated graft used for aortic arch replacement between September 1999 and September 2009. Seventy-four patients (35.9%) had chronic dissection, 68 patients (33.0%) had atherosclerotic aneurysms, and 39 patients (18.9%) had degenerative disease. Ninety-one patients (44.2%) had undergone previous cardiac surgery. An elephant trunk was placed in 190 patients (92.2%) and completed in 101 patients (53.1%), with an interval of less than 365 days between stages in 94 of 101 patients. Hospital mortality was 6.8% (14/206). Adverse outcome (death/stroke within the first year postoperatively) occurred in 27.7% of patients (57/206; 50 deaths/7 strokes). Among 152 1-year survivors, the annual rates of transient ischemic attack and stroke were 0.85% and 1.1%, respectively. At 6 years, 75% of patients were still alive, compared with 92% in a matched New York State control population (P < .001). Follow-up computed tomography scans (189 studies in 176/206 patients [85.4%]) revealed 100% patency of the trifurcated graft limbs at a mean of 2.3 years. Aortic arch replacement using a trifurcated graft is highly durable, with excellent patency in the branch grafts, and is associated with a low incidence of cerebral embolization. However, the long-term outcome in these patients is compromised by extensive comorbidities.

The Bentall procedure: is it the gold standard? A series of 597 consecutive cases.
We compared aortic root reconstructions using conduits with biological valves and mechanical valves. Of 597 patients (1995-2008), 307 (mean age 71 years [23-89 years]) had biological valves and 290 (mean age 51 years [21-82 years]) had mechanical valves. The subgroup of 242 patients aged 50 to 70 years included 133 with biological and 109 with mechanical valves. Overall hospital mortality was 3.9% with biological valves (n = 15; elective: 3.7% [n = 10]) versus 2.8% with mechanical valves (n = 8; elective: 1.4% [n = 3]). In patients 50 to 70 years, age greater than 65 years (relative risk: 3.3 [P = .0001]), clot (relative risk: 2.5 [P = .05]), coronary artery disease (relative risk:3.5 [P < .0001]), and degenerative etiology (relative risk: 0.4 [P = .006]) were independent risk factors for long-term survival (after postoperative day 30); there was no difference in long-term survival between biological and mechanical valves (relative risk: 0.9 [P = .74]). The linearized rate for valve/ascending aorta reoperation was 0.86%/pt-y (2 in 2310 pt-y) after mechanical valves and 2.5%/pt-y (4 in 1586 pt-y) after Bentall procedures with the biological valve. The choice of valve for aortic root reconstruction seems to have no influence on long-term outcome. Emergency operation and the presence of clot/atheroma have a significant impact on short-term outcome. Reoperation for either ascending aorta and/or aortic valve is low.

When to operate on the bicuspid valve patient with a modestly dilated ascending aorta.
Bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) are frequently associated with root/ascending aorta dilatation, but there is controversy regarding when to operate to prevent dissection of a dilated aorta associated with a well-functioning BAV. From 1988 through 2008, 158 patients (mean age: 56 ± 13.5 years) with a dilated ascending aorta (AA) and a well-functioning BAV were referred to our institution. All patients underwent computed tomographic (CT) scanning and digitization to calculate mean AA diameter. Forty-two patients underwent operation a median of 52 days after initial CT scan with a mean AA diameter of 5.6 ± 0.5 cm. One hundred sixteen patients (mean diameter 4.6 ± 0.5 cm) were enrolled in annual or semiannual surveillance. Seventy-one patients, 45 with 2 or more CT scans, are still under surveillance. Average follow-up was 6.5 ± 4.1 years. Overall survival after the first encounter was 93% at 5 years and 85% at 10 years. A total of 87 of 158 patients had a Bentall or Yacoub procedure, with two hospital deaths (2.3%). Mean duration of surveillance in the 116 patients without immediate operation was 4.2 ± 2.9 years (481 patient-years). Average growth rate of the AA in patients with 2 scans or greater was 0.77 mm/year (p < 0.0001 versus normal population) with no significant impact of hypertension, sex, smoking or age. Forty-five of the 116 surveillance patients underwent operation after a mean of 3.4 ± 2.9 years (mean age 55 ± 14.7 years; mean AA diameter 4.9 ± 0.6 cm). Six patients died without surgery, median age 82 (range, 44 to 87) years, but none within one year of the last CT scan. A consistent approach to patients with a well-functioning BAV and AA dilatation, recommending operation to those with an AA diameter greater than 5 cm and deferring operation in patients under surveillance in the absence of significant enlargement (>0.5 cm/year), resulted in overall survival equivalent to a normal age-matched and sex-matched population. Operation was necessary in approximately 10% of patients under surveillance each year.

Internet-based assessment of postoperative neurocognitive function in cardiac and thoracic aortic surgery patients.
The primary purpose of this study was to determine the practicality of long-term, postoperative neurocognitive assessment via remote Internet-based testing in a cohort of patients who had undergone cardiac or thoracic aortic surgery within the previous 6 years. The secondary aim of this study was to examine the relationships among hypothermic circulatory arrest time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and selective cerebral perfusion time with long-term postoperative neurocognitive function, as assessed by this novel testing method. Three hundred patients who had undergone cardiac and/or proximal aortic surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (n = 207), thoracic aortic surgery with hypothermic circulatory arrest (n = 67), or thoracic aortic surgery with hypothermic circulatory arrest and selective cerebral perfusion (n = 26) within the previous 6 years underwent Internet-based neurocognitive assessment. The duration of hypothermic circulatory arrest was negatively associated with processing speed scores and memory scores; arrest duration greater than 21 to 24 minutes was negatively associated with response speed scores. These associations were independent of time since surgery, age at testing, and educational level. Neither cardiopulmonary bypass duration nor selective cerebral perfusion duration was associated with test score results. This study demonstrated the practicality of long-term neurocognitive assessment of patients who have undergone cardiac and thoracic aortic surgery by means of Internet-based computerized testing. Furthermore, there was a negative association between the duration of intraoperative hypothermic circulatory arrest and long-term postoperative neurocognitive function that needs further examination in prospective studies.

Predicting the risk of paraplegia after thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair.
Endovascular repair of descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms is an appealing alternative to the standard surgical approach, but precludes revascularization of segmental arteries (SAs). For safer surgical and endovascular repairs, an accurate prediction of the risk of paraplegia in relation to the extent of SA sacrifice is needed. From January 1994 to October 2008, 609 patients (mean age, 63 ± 14 years) underwent surgical descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair without SA reimplantation. Three hundred seventy-six patients (62%) were male; 159 (26%) had urgent or emergent operation; 199 (33%) had previous aortic surgery. Somatosensory- or motor-evoked potential monitoring and cerebrospinal fluid drainage were routinely performed. Hospital mortality was 10.7% (65 patients). Spinal cord injury (SCI) occurred in 3.4% (21 patients). The extent of resection-expressed as the number of SAs sacrificed (p = 0.007)-and the need for visceral artery reimplantation (p = 0.03) were independent risk factors for paraplegia. Further analysis identified four risk groups (p < 0.0001): fewer than 8 SAs sacrificed (group A, SCI = 1.2%); sacrifice of 8 to 12 SAs with proximal origin in the upper thorax (group B, SCI = 3.7%); 8 to 12 SAs sacrificed beginning in the lower thorax (group C, SCI = 15.4%); and 13 or more SAs sacrificed (group D, SCI = 12.5%). This four-group model more accurately predicts SCI risk than the Crawford classification (goodness of fit c statistic: 0.748 versus 0.640). The extent of SA sacrifice is the most powerful predictor of paraplegia risk. For aneurysms of moderate extent, a more distal location involving the abdominal aorta increases the risk of spinal cord injury. Sacrifice of fewer than 8 SAs is associated with a very low paraplegia risk regardless of location.

Experimental two-stage simulated repair of extensive thoracoabdominal aneurysms reduces paraplegia risk.
In a pig model, we compared spinal cord injury after extensive segmental artery (SA) sacrifice in a single stage with recovery after a two-stage procedure: lumbar artery followed by thoracic SA sacrifice. Twenty juvenile Yorkshire pigs were randomly assigned to undergo extensive SA sacrifice at 32 degrees C in a single operation (group 1, n = 10), or thoracic SA ligation 7 days after lumbar artery sacrifice (group 2, n = 10). Spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP) was monitored using a catheter placed in the distal stump of L1. Hind limb function was evaluated intraoperatively using motor-evoked potentials and for 5 days postoperatively using a modified Tarlov score. Motor-evoked potentials were intact in all pigs until 1 hour after surgery. All pigs in group 2 fully recovered hind limb function, whereas 40% in group 1 experienced paraplegia (median Tarlov scores 9 versus 7; p = 0.004). Group 1 SCPP fell to 28 +/- 6 mm Hg after SA sacrifice, compared with 44 +/- 8 mm Hg in group 2 (p < 0.0001). After sacrifice of all residual SAs, SCPP in group 2 remained consistently greater than 85% of baseline, significantly higher than group 1 SCPP from end clamping until 72 hours (p = 0.0002). Histopathologic analysis showed more severe ischemic damage to the lower thoracic (p < 0.001) and lumbar spinal cord (p = 0.01) in group 1. In contrast with the single-stage approach, a two-stage procedure, starting with ligation of six or fewer lumbar SAs, leads to only a mild drop in SCPP and stimulates vascular remodeling, minimizing the impact of subsequent SA sacrifice on spinal cord function. The greater safety of extensive SA sacrifice when undertaken in two stages has important implications for endovascular and hybrid aneurysm repair.

Extracorporeal peritoneovenous shunt for the management of postaneurysmectomy chylous ascites in a Marfan patient.
Chylous ascites is an uncommon complication after aortic and other retroperitoneal surgeries. The management is very specific to the etiology and clinical status of the patient. The mortality from chylous ascites is not negligible, and aggressive measures are often needed. A voluminous chylous ascites developed in a 38-year-old woman after an open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair that was refractive to initial therapeutic interventions. We used an extracorporeal peritoneovenous shunt to control the abdominal ascites and improve the patient's immunologic and nutritional status.

Noninvasive cerebral oxygenation may predict outcome in patients undergoing aortic arch surgery.
Surgical repair of the aortic arch remains technically challenging and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Cerebral oximetry is a noninvasive technology that can monitor the regional oxygen saturation of the frontal cortex. We hypothesized that magnitude and duration of decreased intraoperative regional oxygen saturation was associated with postoperative organ dysfunction. Additionally, we sought to identify regional oxygen saturation threshold values that are predictive of organ dysfunction. The intraoperative regional oxygen saturation values of 30 patients undergoing aortic arch surgery were recorded and analyzed. Postoperative complications were categorized as "major" and "minor." Severe adverse outcome, extubation time, intensive care unit length of stay, and hospital length of stay data were collected and compared with the integrals of regional oxygen saturation and time (area under the threshold) spent beneath predetermined absolute threshold limits. Twenty subjects underwent hemiarch replacement, and 10 subjects received total aortic arch replacements. There were 30 major and 29 minor complications identified. Sixteen (53.3%) patients had at least 1 major complication. Logistic regression showed statistically significant associations between area under the threshold and severe adverse outcome incidence for regional oxygen saturation thresholds of 60% (P = .038) and 65% (P = .025). Patients who spent more than 30 minutes under the absolute threshold of 60% had an extended hospital stay of 4 days leading to an additional cost of $8300.00. Our findings lend evidence to support the association of decreased perioperative cerebral oxygenation values with poor outcomes after aortic arch surgery.

Staged repair significantly reduces paraplegia rate after extensive thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
Paraplegia remains a devastating, and still too frequent, complication after repair of extensive thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Strategies to prevent ischemic spinal cord damage after extensive segmental artery sacrifice-or occlusion, essential for endovascular repair-are still evolving. Ninety patients who underwent extensive segmental artery sacrifice (median, 13; range, 9-15) during open surgical repair from June 1994 to December 2007 were reviewed retrospectively. Fifty-five patients (mean age, 65 +/- 12 years; 49% were male), most with extensive Crawford type II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, had a single procedure (single-stage group). Thirty-five patients (mean age, 62 +/- 14 years; 57% were male) had 2 procedures (2-stage group), usually Crawford type III or IV repair after operation for Crawford type I descending thoracic aneurysm. The median interval between the 2-stage procedures was 5 years (3 months to 17 years). There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to age, gender, cause of the aneurysm, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, urgency, previous cerebrovascular accidents, year of procedure, or cerebrospinal fluid drainage. In single-stage procedures, hypothermic circulatory arrest was used in 29% of patients, left-sided heart bypass was used in 40% of patients, and partial cardiopulmonary bypass was used in 27% of patients. Somatosensory-evoked potentials were monitored in all patients, and motor-evoked potentials were monitored in 39% of patients. Cerebrospinal fluid was drained in 84% of patients. Overall hospital mortality was 11.1%. There were no significant differences in mortality, stroke, postoperative bleeding, infection, renal failure, or pulmonary insufficiency between the groups. However, 15% of patients in the single-stage group had permanent spinal cord injury versus none in the 2-stage group (P = .02). The significantly lower rate of paraplegia and paraparesis in the 2-stage group occurred despite a significantly higher number of segmental arteries sacrificed in this group: a median of 14 (11-15) versus 12 (9-15) (P < .0001). A staged approach to extensive thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair may reduce the incidence of spinal cord injury. This is of particular importance in designing strategies involving hybrid or entirely endovascular procedures.

Long-term survival after open repair of chronic distal aortic dissection.
The optimal treatment of chronic distal aortic dissection remains controversial, with endovascular stent-graft techniques challenging traditional surgery. From January 1994 to April 2007, 104 patients (82 male, median age 60.5 years) with chronic distal aortic dissection underwent surgical repair, 0 to 21 years after initial diagnosis of acute type A or B dissection (median 2.1 years). Twenty-three (22%) patients underwent urgent-emergent surgery. Mean aortic diameter was 6.9 +/- 1.4 cm. Indications for surgery, other than aortic expansion, were pain in 6 (6%) patients, malperfusion in 6 (6%), and rupture in 11 (11%). Forty-nine (47%) had previous cardioaortic surgery (29% dissection-related), 21 (20%) had coronary artery disease, 12 (12%) had Marfan syndrome, and 4 (4%) were on chronic dialysis. Twenty-six (25%) had a thrombosed false lumen. Thirty (29%) patients required reimplantation of visceral arteries; 8.3 +/- 2.7 segmental artery pairs were sacrificed. Hospital mortality was 9.6% (10 patients). Paraplegia occurred in 5 (4.8%). Twenty-seven patients (26%) experienced adverse outcome (death within one year, paraplegia, stroke, or dialysis). Adverse outcome was associated with atheroma (p = 0.04, odds ratio = 4.3). Survival was 78% at 1, 68% at 5, and 59% at 10 years (average follow-up, 7.7 +/- 4.1 years). Freedom from distal aortic reoperation was 99% at 1, 93% at 5, and 83% at 10 years. After one year, patients enjoyed longevity equivalent to a normal age-sex matched population (standardized mortality ratio = 1.38, p = 0.23). By multivariate analysis, atheroma (p = 0.0005, relative risk = 9.32) and age (p = 0.0003, relative risk = 1.15/year) were risk factors for long-term survival. The efficacy of open repair for distal chronic dissection is highlighted by normal survival after the first year, and a low reoperation-reintervention rate.

Redo lateral thoracotomy for reoperative descending and thoracoabdominal aortic repair: a consecutive series of 60 patients.
Reoperative descending thoracic aorta (DTA) or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) surgery is a challenge because of increased risk of lung injury and diffuse bleeding. Sixty patients (34 male, mean age 54.4 years) underwent redo thoracotomy for DTA (22 patients) or extended thoracoabdominal incision for reoperative TAAA (38 patients) from March 1988 to June 2007, after 1.7 +/- 0.9 previous cardioaortic procedures. Forty-one patients were hypertensive (68%), 18 were smokers (30%), 9 had Marfan syndrome (15%), 9 had coronary artery disease (15%), 5 had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (8%), and 3 had diabetes mellitus (5%). In all, 45% (27 patients) had previous dissection, 30% (18) had atherosclerotic aneurysms, 15% had coarctation surgery (9), and 6 patients had other etiologies. Mean follow-up, 100% complete, was 6.5 years. Hospital mortality for reoperative DTA/TAAA was 13.3% (8 patients). Although 6.3 +/- 2.9 (0 to 14) segmental artery pairs were sacrificed at reoperation-and 6.2 +/- 2.3 (1 to 12) initially-for a total of 10.6 +/- 3.9 (2 to 15) segmental artery pairs sacrificed, only 1 patient had paraplegia (1.6%). Four patients had a 2-day procedure, with 12 to 24 hours of intensive care unit recovery after lysis of extensive adhesions: all survived. Respiratory complications occurred in 13 patients (21.6%), and permanent dialysis was required in 2 (3.3%), but there were no strokes. Adverse outcome-1-year mortality, stroke, permanent dialysis, or paraplegia-occurred in 13 patients (21.6%). Adverse outcome was marginally associated (p < 0.2) with increased age, atherosclerotic aneurysms (33% versus 17% other), TAA incision (30% versus 9%), and greater aneurysm extent, and was significantly associated with perfusion technique (p = 0.02). Adverse outcome occurred in 3 of 4 patients who had clamp-and-sew technique, 6 of 21 using partial cardiopulmonary bypass (28.6%), and 3 of 17 with partial left heart bypass (17.7%), but only 1 of 18 with hypothermic circulatory arrest (5.6%). Reoperative DTA/TAAA repair was significantly safer with hypothermic circulatory arrest rather than partial cardiopulmonary bypass, partial left heart bypass, or clamp-and-sew strategy. A 2-day procedure may be advisable for patients with extensive adhesions.

Aortic arch resection and ligation of the descending thoracic aorta to manage a ruptured thoracoabdominal aneurysm.
Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) are treated traditionally with open surgical repair; however, selective, high-risk patients can be evaluated for an endovascular approach. If the TAAA is complicated by the presence of aortic rupture, open surgical intervention is conventionally the course of action. However, unlike the primary operation, reoperations of TAAA might necessitate less conventional approaches. We report a patient with a previously repaired, ruptured, acute type B aortic dissection, who presents with a contained rupture of a TAAA.

Selective cerebral perfusion at 28 degrees C--is the spinal cord safe?
To shorten cooling/rewarming associated with hypothermic neuroprotection strategies during complex aortic arch surgery, selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) at 28 degrees C has recently been advocated, although its safe limits - especially with regard to the ischaemic tolerance of the spinal cord - have not been systematically examined. Twenty juvenile Yorkshire pigs (30.3+/-2.8kg) were randomly allocated to undergo circulatory arrest and SCP at 28 degrees C for 90 min (group A; N=12) or 120 min (group B; N=8) at 50 mmHg using alpha-stat pH management. Spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) was assessed using fluorescent microspheres at baseline (prior to SCP); at 5 and 80 min during SCP, and at 1, 5 and 48 h after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). A modified Tarlov score was used to evaluate neurobehavioural recovery in all survivors blindly from videotapes for 5 days postoperatively. Histological ischaemic spinal cord injury was scored after sacrifice. All pigs could be weaned from CPB and ventilation, but seven pigs (58%) in group A and five (63%) in group B developed multi-organ failure and died within 24h. SCBF diminished immediately after initiation of SCP and was absent throughout SCP in all segments below T8/9, recovering to baseline 1h after SCP at all cord levels. All survivors suffered moderate-to-severe histological lumbar spinal cord damage, more severe in group B (p< or =0.049). Three of five group A pigs recovered normal function, but two suffered paraparesis. Group B survivors had a worse neurologic outcome (p<0.0001): all suffered paraplegia (one immediate, and two on day 2, after initial recovery). SCP provides insufficient SCBF below T8/9 to sustain cord viability. At 28 degrees C, the ischaemic tolerance of the cord may be exceeded enough by 90 min to impair function; by 120 min, SCP at 28 degrees C invariably results in paraplegia.

Direct spinal cord perfusion pressure monitoring in extensive distal aortic aneurysm repair.
Although maintenance of adequate spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP) by the paraspinal collateral network is critical to the success of surgical and endovascular repair of descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, direct monitoring of SCPP has not previously been described. A catheter was inserted into the distal end of a ligated thoracic segmental artery (SA) (T6 to L1) in 13 patients, 7 of whom underwent descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Spinal cord perfusion pressure was recorded from this catheter before, during, and after serial SA sacrifice, in pairs, from T3 through L4, at 32 degrees C. Somatosensory and motor evoked potentials were also monitored during SA sacrifice and until 1 hour after cardiopulmonary bypass. Target mean arterial pressure was 90 mm Hg during SA sacrifice and after nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass, and 60 mm Hg during cardiopulmonary bypass. A mean of 9.8 +/- 2.6 SAs were sacrificed without somatosensory and motor evoked potential loss. Spinal cord perfusion pressure fell from 62 +/- 12 mm Hg (76% +/- 11% of mean arterial pressure) before SA sacrifice to 53 +/- 13 mm Hg (58% +/- 15% of mean arterial pressure) after SA clamping. The most significant drop occurred with initiation of nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass, reaching 29 +/- 11 mm Hg (46% +/- 18% of mean arterial pressure) before deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Spinal cord perfusion pressure recovered during rewarming to 40 +/- 14 mm Hg (51% +/- 20% of mean arterial pressure), and further within the first hour of reestablished pulsatile flow. Somatosensory and motor evoked potentials returned in all patients intraoperatively. Recovery of SCPP began intraoperatively, and in 5 patients with prolonged monitoring, continued during the first 24 hours postoperatively. All but 1 patient, who had remarkably low postoperative SCPPs and experienced paraparesis, regained normal spinal cord function. This study supports experimental data showing that SCPP drops markedly but then recovers gradually during the first several hours after extensive SA sacrifice. Direct monitoring may help prevent a fall of SCPP below levels critical for spinal cord recovery after surgery and endovascular repair of descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.

Supradiaphragmatic inferior vena cava cannulation for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
The selection of the cannulation site and the operative scheme is essential to the preoperative preparation for the repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysms. The site of cannulation will determine the mode of cardiopulmonary support and preparedness for deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. On rare occasions, optimal femoral venous access for establishing cardiopulmonary bypass is not possible. We present our experience with cannulation of the supradiaphragmatic inferior vena cava.

Reoperative aortic root and transverse arch procedures: a comparison with contemporaneous primary operations.
Long-term survival and risk factors affecting outcome after reoperative root/ascending aorta and transverse arch procedures have not been clearly described. Two hundred patients (138 male patients; age, 60 +/- 15 years) underwent reoperative root/ascending aorta (n = 100) or transverse arch (n = 100) procedures at our institution from January 1998 to December 2004 and were compared with 480 consecutive contemporaneous patients with primary procedures (323 male patients; age, 62 +/- 16 years; 335 proximal aorta and 145 transverse arch procedures). Reoperative proximal aorta procedures had a higher hospital mortality (7%) than primary root/ascending aorta procedures (3%), but there was a less dramatic difference in operative mortality after primary and reoperative arch procedures (9% vs 10%). Separate multivariable analyses of root/ascending aorta procedures and arch procedures revealed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and age to be significant risk factors for death after either procedure. In addition, an ejection fraction of less than 30% posed a significant risk for proximal aortic surgery, and diabetes and nonelective operations predicted poorer outcome after arch operations. For survivors of root/ascending aorta operations, there was no significant difference in long-term outcome between reoperations and primary procedures, with both restoring longevity to expected levels for an age- and sex-matched normal population. Patients undergoing arch operations, however, continued to have a poorer long-term outlook than their normal peers. In this series, reoperations in the transverse arch carry the same risk as primary arch procedures, but a higher operative mortality is seen with reoperative than with primary root/ascending aorta procedures. The long-term outlook is better for patients undergoing root/ascending operations than for patients undergoing aortic arch operations, with no difference in the longevity of patients undergoing primary procedures versus reoperations.

Axillary cannulation significantly improves survival and neurologic outcome after atherosclerotic aneurysm repair of the aortic root and ascending aorta.
The impact of axillary artery cannulation (AXC) on survival and neurologic outcome after operation for ascending aortic disease was retrospectively evaluated. We reviewed 869 patients with ascending aorta/root repairs (1995 to 2005), principally for atherosclerotic and degenerative aneurysms and chronic and acute type A dissections. Arterial cannulation was through the ascending aorta (AAC) in 157 patients, the femoral artery (FAC) in 261, and the right axillary artery (AXC) in 451. Patients cannulated at different sites were compared for preoperative comorbidities and outcomes (mortality and stroke) for each cause. Of the 122 patients with atherosclerotic aneurysms, 66 with right AXC had significantly better outcomes (p = 0.02): 64 of 66 survived vs 24 of 26 with FAC and 27 with 30 of AAC; no strokes occurred (vs 2 of 26 with FAC and 4 of 30 with AAC). No significant advantage for AXC was found with ascending aortic operation in 495 degenerative aneurysms, 106 chronic, or 65 acute type A dissections, 41 patients with endocarditis, or in 18 with aneurysms of other causes; AXC was associated with a significantly better outcome (p = 0.05) in the 869 patients taken together. AXC resulted in superior survival and neurologic outcome in patients with atherosclerotic aneurysms and a marginally better outcome than with cannulation at other sites during proximal aortic procedures for all causes. This study supports AXC in patients with atherosclerotic disease who require complex cardiothoracic operations and in patients requiring proximal aortic intervention regardless of cause.

Staged repair of thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms using the elephant trunk technique: a consecutive series of 215 first stage and 120 complete repairs.
Repair of thoracic aneurysms (TA) involving the ascending, arch, and descending aorta results in substantial morbidity and mortality. This study evaluates outcomes with a two-stage elephant trunk (ET) technique. Two hundred and fifteen consecutive patients (pts) underwent total arch replacement using an ET (02/90-09/06). One hundred and thirty-nine pts (65%), group PC (planned completion; median age 68; 28-86 years), had extensive descending TA (Ø>/=5 cm) or dissections requiring complete repair. Seventy-six pts (35%), group CS (close surveillance; median age: 68; 20-87 years), had less severe distal dilatation (Ø</=5 cm), and had close follow-up after ET rather than planned distal repair. Hospital mortality in group PC pts (descending Ø: 6.2+/-1.2 cm) was 6.5% (9/139) following ET. In group CS pts (descending Ø: 4.1+/-0.7 cm), hospital mortality after ET was 5.3% (4/76); 4.7% (10/215) had strokes but survived. Eighty-six percent (112/130) of group PC pts who survived proximal repair returned for planned surgical (101) or endovascular (11) completion after a median of 56 (0-2189) days. Hospital mortality for distal repair was 7.5% (9/120); two ET stage two pts (2%) developed paraplegia. Eighty-nine percent (16/18; descending Ø: 6.9+/-1.0 cm) of group PC pts who did not undergo planned completion died a median of 5.4 (1.2-91.1) months after ET stage one. Overall cumulative survival in group PC, which includes pts dying before or without stage two, was 69% after 1, and 55% after 5 years. Survival in group CS pts was 88% at 1, and 57% at 5 years. Eight pts in group CS subsequently underwent distal repair, but 22/76 (29%) group CS pts who survived ET stage one died during follow-up despite surveillance. The low mortality after stage one justifies liberal use of the ET technique to facilitate future open or endovascular TA repair of the distal aorta. The 5-year cumulative mortality curves, however, suggest that staged repair of extensive TA is superior to one-step repair only if stage two can be done before rupture occurs. If one-step repair is possible, it may be preferable.

Optimizing selective cerebral perfusion: deleterious effects of high perfusion pressures.
Selective cerebral perfusion is a proven adjunct to hypothermia for neuroprotection in complex aortic surgery. The ideal conditions for the provision of selective cerebral perfusion, however, including optimal perfusion pressure, remain unknown. We investigated the effects of various perfusion pressures during selective cerebral perfusion on cerebral physiology and outcome in a long-term porcine model. Thirty piglets (26.3 +/- 1.4 kg), cooled to 20 degrees C on cardiopulmonary bypass with alpha-stat pH management (mean hematocrit 23.6%), were randomly assigned to 90 minutes of selective cerebral perfusion at a pressure of 50 (group A), 70 (group B), or 90 (group C) mm Hg. With fluorescent microspheres and sagittal sinus sampling, cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen metabolism were assessed at baseline, after cooling, at two points during selective cerebral perfusion, and for 2 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass. Visual evoked potentials were monitored during recovery. Neurobehavioral scores were assessed blindly from standardized videotaped sessions for 7 postoperative days. Cerebral blood flow during selective cerebral perfusion was significantly increased by higher-pressure perfusion (P = .04), although all groups sustained similar levels of cerebral oxygen metabolism during selective cerebral perfusion (P = .88). After the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, the cerebral oxygen metabolism increased to above baseline in all groups, with the highest levels seen in group C (P = .06). Intracranial pressure was significantly higher during selective cerebral perfusion in group C (P = .0002); visual evoked potentials did not differ among groups. Neurobehavioral scores were significantly better in group A (P = .0002). Selective cerebral perfusion at 50 mm Hg provides neuroprotection superior to that at higher pressures. The increased cerebral blood flow with higher-pressure selective cerebral perfusion is associated with cerebral injury, reflected by high post-cardiopulmonary bypass cerebral oxygen metabolism and poorer neurobehavioral recovery.

Spinal cord blood flow and ischemic injury after experimental sacrifice of thoracic and abdominal segmental arteries.
Spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) after sacrifice of thoracoabdominal aortic segmental arteries (TAASA) during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair remains poorly understood. This study explored SCBF for 72 h after sacrifice of all TAASA. Fourteen juvenile Yorkshire pigs underwent complete serial TAASA sacrifice (T4-L5). Six control pigs underwent anesthesia and cooling to 32 degrees C with no TAASA sacrifice. In the experimental animals, spinal cord function was continuously monitored using motor evoked potentials (MEPs) until 1h after clamping the last TAASA. Fluorescent microspheres enabled segmental measurement of SCBF along the entire spinal cord before, and 5 min, 1 h, 5 h, 24 h and 72 h after complete TAASA sacrifice. A modified Tarlov score was obtained for 3 days after surgery. All the pigs with complete TAASA sacrifice retained normal cord function (MEP) until 1h after TAASA ligation. Seven pigs (50%) with complete TAASA sacrifice recovered after 72 h; seven pigs suffered paraparesis or paraplegia. Intraoperatively, and until 1h postoperatively, SCBF was similar among the three groups along the entire cord. Postoperatively, SCBF did not decrease in any group, but significant hyperemia occurred at 5h in controls and recovery animals, but did not occur in pigs that developed paraparesis or paraplegia in the T8-L2 segments (p=0.0002) and L3-S segments (p=0.0007). At 24h, SCBF remained marginally lower from T8 caudally; at 72h, SCBF was similar among all groups along the entire cord. SCBF in the segments T8-L2 at 5h predicted functional recovery (p=0.003). This study suggests that critical spinal cord ischemia after complete TAASA sacrifice does not occur immediately (intraoperatively), but is delayed 1-5h or longer after clamping, and represents failure to mount a hyperemic response to rewarming and awakening. The short duration of low SCBF associated with spinal cord injury suggests that hemodynamic and metabolic manipulation lasting only 24-72 h may allow routine preservation of normal cord function despite sacrifice of all TAASA secondary to surgical or endovascular repair of large TAAA.

Paraplegia after extensive thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair: does critical spinal cord ischemia occur postoperatively?
Spinal cord injury can occur not only during extensive thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair but also postoperatively, causing delayed-onset paraplegia. A series of 858 thoracoabdominal aneurysm repairs (June 1990-June 2006) with an overall paraplegia rate of 2.7% was analyzed retrospectively. Serial segmental artery sacrifice was monitored by using somatosensory evoked potentials; segmental arteries were not reimplanted. Of a total of 20 cases of paraplegia, 3 occurred intraoperatively and 7 occurred late postoperatively: these will not be analyzed further. In 10 cases (the paraplegia group) spinal cord injury occurred within 48 hours after thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair, despite intact somatosensory evoked potentials at the end of the procedure. These patients with early postoperative delayed paraplegia were compared with 10 matched control subjects who recovered without spinal cord injury. In the paraplegia group a median of 9 segmental arteries (range, 5-12 segmental arteries) were sacrificed. There were 9 male subjects: median age was 63 years (range, 40-79 years), and 4 of 10 had cerebrospinal fluid drainage. A median of 9 segmental arteries (range, 2-12 segmental arteries) were also sacrificed in the matched recovery group. There were 4 male subjects; median age was 66 years (range, 40-78 years), and 8 of 10 had cerebrospinal fluid drainage. During the first 48 hours postoperatively, there were no significant differences in arterial and mixed venous oxygen saturation, partial arterial O2 and CO2 pressures, body temperature, glucose, hematocrit, or pH. The mean central venous pressures, however, were significantly higher in the paraplegic patients from 1 to 5 hours postoperatively (P = .03). In addition, although absolute mean aortic pressures did not differ between matched pairs postoperatively, when pressures were considered as a percentage of individual antecedent preoperative mean aortic pressure, paraplegic patients had significantly lower values during the first 5 hours postoperatively (P = .03). This study suggests that paraplegia can result from inadequate postoperative spinal cord perfusion caused by relatively minor differences from control subjects in perfusion parameters. Delayed paraplegia can perhaps be prevented with better hemodynamic and fluid management.

Delayed repair of acute type A aortic dissection in a patient with gastrointestinal bleeding and pulse deficit.
Acute type A aortic dissections are considered surgical emergencies because these patients are at risk for life-threatening complications. Patients who present with significant neurologic and other end-organ malperfusion may benefit from a more conservative approach. We present a patient with type A aortic dissection and concomitant mesenteric and limb ischemia.

Vascular graft replacement of the ascending and descending aorta: do Dacron grafts grow?
The tendency of Dacron vascular grafts to expand after placement in the ascending and descending thoracic aorta has been noted, but never described in detail. From 1986 to 2005, two or more computed tomography studies were obtained as part of routine postoperative surveillance in patients with Dacron grafts implanted to replace diseased aortic segments. Scans were digitized to evaluate the entire thoracic aorta. The median diameters of 547 grafts (18 to 34 mm) in the ascending (349) and descending (198) aorta were calculated from more than 2,000 postoperative computed tomography scans. In scans obtained 7 or fewer days after implantation, the median graft diameters increased from the manufacturer's measurement by 17% in the ascending aorta (n = 169; interquartile range, 11% to 21%; p < 0.0001) and 21% in the descending aorta (n = 63; interquartile range, 12% to 25%; p < 0.0001). From an initial scan within 30 days to at least one other within 18 months after implantation, ascending aorta grafts dilated further, at a median rate of 2.8% per year (n = 143; interquartile range, -2.2% to +6.9%; p = 0.0001). Descending grafts dilated less markedly: 1.1% per year (n = 80; interquartile range, -4.0% to +6.1%; p = 0.14). After 18 months, median graft expansion gradually diminished to less than 1% per year. Significant initial expansion and early growth of woven vascular Dacron grafts occurs; it is slightly different in the ascending and descending aorta. Graft expansion should be anticipated when selecting grafts for aortic valve-sparing procedures to prevent development of regurgitation, and, for endoluminal repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysms, to prevent development of type III endoleaks in the projected landing zone.

Long-term survival after the Bentall procedure in 206 patients with bicuspid aortic valve.
The recognition that patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) are at risk for aorta-related death (rupture or dissection) has favored composite aortic root replacement in BAV patients who undergo aortic valve replacement for valve dysfunction as well as in asymptomatic BAV patients with significant aortic root dilatation. We report the results of Bentall operations in 206 BAV patients during an 18-year interval. Two hundred six BAV patients (mean, 53 +/- 14 years, 84% male) underwent composite aortic root replacement between September 1987 and May 2005. One hundred nine patients (53%) presented with aortic regurgitation, 24 patients (12%) presented with aortic stenosis, and 55 patients (26%) presented with combined aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation. Median preoperative aortic diameter was 5.5 cm (range, 3 to 9 cm). Twenty-two patients (11%) underwent urgent or emergent procedures; 11 had acute type A dissection (5%). Sixty-one percent had a mechanical valve Bentall prosthesis; in 39%, a biologic valve was implanted. Thirty-two percent had concomitant procedures. Overall hospital mortality was 2.9% (n = 6), and stroke rate was 1.9% (n = 4). Risk factors for adverse outcome (death or stroke), which occurred in 4.8% (n = 10), were presence of clot or atheroma (p = 0.02) and age older than 65 years (p = 0.05). During a mean follow-up of 5.9 years (1,200 patient-years; range, 5 to 18 patient-years), no patient required ascending aortic reoperation. Long-term survival was 93% after 5 years and 89% after 10 years. Discharged patients enjoyed survival equivalent to a normal age- and sex-matched population and superior to survival reported for a series of patients with aortic valve replacement alone. In patients with BAV, the Bentall procedure has an operative mortality no worse than that for aortic valve replacement, with superior long-term survival and a lower rate of aortic reoperation.

Preservation of spinal cord function after extensive segmental artery sacrifice: regional variations in perfusion.
Sacrifice of intercostal and lumbar arteries simplifies thoracoabdominal aneurysm surgery and enables endovascular stenting. Little is known about alterations in cord perfusion after extensive segmental artery sacrifice. We explored this question using hypothermia to reduce metabolism. Twelve juvenile Yorkshire pigs (mean weight, 22.3 kg) were randomized to segmental artery sacrifice at 32 degrees C or 37 degrees C. Cord integrity was assessed with myogenic-evoked potential (MEP) monitoring. Stepwise craniocaudal sacrifice of segmental arteries was continued until MEP diminution occurred; the last segmental artery was then reopened. Fluorescent microspheres were used to measure spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) at baseline, 5 minutes, 1 hour, and 3 hours after segmental artery sacrifice. Hind limb function was monitored for 5 days. All animals recovered normal hind limb function. At 32 degrees C, more segmental arteries, 16.5 versus 15 (p = 0.03), could be sacrificed without MEP loss. Baseline SCBF at 32 degrees C was 50% that at 37 degrees C (p = 0.003) and remained fairly stable throughout. At 37 degrees C, SCBF to the craniocaudal extremes of the cord (C1 to T3 and L2 to L6) increased markedly (p = 0.01) at 1 hour and returned toward normal at 3 hours. Concomitantly, SCBF fell in the middle portion of the cord (T9 to T13) at 1 hour before returning to normal at 3 hours. Almost all segmental arteries can be sacrificed with preservation of spinal cord function. No major change occurs in the central cord in normothermic animals, but there is significant transient hyperemia in segments adjacent to extrasegmental vessels. Hypothermia reduces SCBF and abolishes this possible steal phenomenon. Metabolic and hemodynamic manipulation should enable routine sacrifice of all segmental arteries without spinal cord injury.

Perfusing the cold brain: optimal neuroprotection for aortic surgery.
Selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) may enhance the neuroprotective benefits of hypothermia during aortic surgery. However, despite its widespread adoption, there is no consensus regarding optimal implementation of SCP. We used a survival porcine model to explore the physiologic characteristics and behavioral benefits of various protocols involving hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) and SCP. Thirty pigs (26.3 +/- 1.4 kg), cooled to 15 degrees C on cardiopulmonary bypass, using alpha-stat pH management (mean hematocrit 30%), were randomly allocated to differing brain protection strategies: 90 minutes of HCA (group A); 30 minutes of HCA, then 60 minutes of SCP (group B); or 90 minutes of SCP (group C). Using fluorescent microspheres and sagittal sinus sampling, cerebral blood flow (CBF [mL x 100g(-1) x min(-1)]) and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2 [mL x 100g(-1) x min(-1)]) were assessed at baseline, after cooling, during SCP (where applicable), and for 2 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass. Neurobehavioral scores were assessed blindly from standardized videotaped sessions for 7 days postoperatively. Cerebral blood flow was significantly higher (p = 0.0001) during SCP (60 and 90 minutes) if preceded by HCA. The CMRO2 was also significantly higher in group B versus group C (p = 0.016) at 60 minutes. The CMRO2 in all three groups rebounded promptly toward baseline after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Postoperative neurobehavioral scores were significantly worse in group A. Continuous SCP provides the best brain protection overall. However, an initial period of HCA does not seem to impair late outcome; perhaps the elevated CBF and CMRO2 observed reflect a beneficial cerebral response to a recoverable insult. Clearly, 90 minutes of HCA induces permanent brain injury, even in this carefully controlled setting.

Avoidance of hemodilution during selective cerebral perfusion enhances neurobehavioral outcome in a survival porcine model.
The ideal hematocrit (HCT) level during hypothermic selective cerebral perfusion (SCP)--to ensure adequate oxygen delivery without excessive perfusion--has not yet been determined. Twenty pigs (26.0+/-2.6 kg) were randomized to low or high HCT management. The cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit was primed with crystalloid in the low HCT group (21+/-1%), and with donor blood in the high HCT group (30+/-1%). Pigs were cooled to 20 degrees C and SCP was carried out for 90 min. During rewarming, whole blood was added in the low HCT group and crystalloid in the high HCT group to produce equivalent HCT levels by the end of the procedure. Using fluorescent microspheres and sagittal sinus sampling, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) were assessed at baseline, after cooling, at two points during SCP (30 and 90 min), and at 15 min and 2 h post-CPB. In addition, a range of physiological and metabolic parameters, including intracranial pressure (ICP), were recorded throughout the procedure. The animals' behavior was videotaped and assessed blindly for 7 days postoperatively (maximum score=5). HCT levels were equivalent at baseline, 2 h post-CPB, and at sacrifice, but significantly different (p<0.0001) during cooling and SCP. Mean arterial pressure, pH and pCO2, and CMRO2 were equivalent between groups throughout. ICP was similar in the two groups throughout cooling, SCP, and rewarming, but was significantly higher in the low HCT animals after the termination of CPB. CBF was similar at baseline, but thereafter markedly higher in the low HCT group. Neurobehavioral performance was significantly better in the high HCT animals (median score 3.5 vs 4.5 on day 3, and 4.5 vs 4.75 on day 7, p=0.003). Higher HCT levels for SCP produced a significantly superior functional outcome, suggesting that the higher CBF with a lower HCT may be injurious, possibly because of an increased embolic load.

Aortic root reconstruction with a bioprosthetic valved conduit: a consecutive series of 275 procedures.
The study objective was to assess the results of aortic root reconstruction using composite conduits with stented bioprosthetic valves. A review was conducted of 275 patients (202 were male, mean age 69 +/- 11 years, range 17-88 years) who underwent aortic root replacement using conduits constructed intraoperatively from pericardial valves and impregnated Dacron grafts between September 1993 and February 2005. There were 151 patients with degenerative aneurysms and 63 patients with atherosclerotic aneurysms; 43 patients had dissections (9 acute type A), 13 patients had endocarditis, and 5 patients had other pathologic conditions. The ascending aorta alone was replaced in 154 patients, a hemiarch reconstruction was performed in 105 patients, and extensive arch reconstruction was performed in 16 patients. Hypothermic circulatory arrest and an open distal anastomosis were used in 95% of patients. Hospital mortality was 17 of 275 patients (6.2%). Four additional patients (1.5%) sustained permanent strokes. Among surviving patients, the rate of stroke was estimated as 0.85 per 100 patient-years and the rate of significant hemorrhage was estimated as 0.3 per 100 patient-years. Reoperation for valve failure occurred in only 1 patient 12 years postoperatively. Long-term survival in men was similar to that of a normal matched control population, but was significantly lower in women (P = .002). Men who recover satisfactorily after reconstruction of the aortic root with a stented bioprosthetic valved conduit (6-month survivors) enjoy long-term outcomes equivalent to that of a normal matched population; the postoperative mortality rate in women is twice that of a normal population.

Anatomy of spinal cord blood supply in the pig.
In a species as popular in research as the pig, little information is available concerning the blood supply and vascular anatomy of the spinal cord and comparability to humans. To visualize vessels contributing to the blood supply of the spinal cord, x-ray digital subtraction angiography and vascular casting by injection of a polymerizing solution of methylmethacrylate were used. The pig has larger internal thoracic arteries and subscapular arteries than the human, providing extensive collateral flow to the lower body, which offers blood supply to the spinal cord through the collaterals. The pig has a fine-caliber vessel plexus providing blood to the neck area, from which flow will reach both the spinal cord and the base of the brain. The segmental thoracic and lumbar arteries are relatively small in pigs, and they almost all originate as a single branch from the aorta and divide after 3 to 4 mm. The segmental vessels show a clear diminution after 2 to 3 cm at the level of the vertebral bodies. Pigs show major differences in the anatomy of the aortic bifurcation compared with humans. The median sacral artery in pigs is a large-caliber vessel, of a size almost comparable to the common iliac artery, with an isolated single dorsal branch leading to the spinal cord. Documenting the anatomic differences in spinal cord blood supply between pigs and humans will aid in the planning of future experimental studies and in determining the clinical relevance of such studies.

Spinal cord perfusion after extensive segmental artery sacrifice: can paraplegia be prevented?
Understanding the ability of the paraspinal anastomotic network to provide adequate spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP) critical for both surgical and endovascular repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA). To monitor pressure in the collateral circulation, a catheter was inserted into the distal end of the divided first lumbar segmental artery (SA) of 10 juvenile Yorkshire pigs (28.9+/-3.8kg). SA pairs from T3 through L5 were serially sacrificed at 32 degrees C; SCPP and function - using motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) - were continuously monitored until 1h after clamping the last SA. Intermittent aortic and SCPP monitoring was continued for 5 days postoperatively, along with evaluation of motor function. A mean of 14.4+/-0.7 SAs were sacrificed without loss of MEP. SCPP (mmHg) dropped from 68+/-7 before SA clamping (77% of aortic pressure) to 22+/-6 at end clamping, and 21+/-4 after 1h, reaching its lowest point - 19+/-4 - after 5h. Postoperatively, SCPP recovered to 33+/-6 at 24h; 42+/-10 at 48h; 56+/-14 at 72h; 62+/-15 at 96h, returning to baseline (63+/-20) at 120h. Despite comparable SCPP patterns, four pigs did not fully regain the ability to stand. Six animals recovered: two could stand and four could walk. Interruption of all SAs at 32 degrees C in this pig model results in a spectrum of cord injury, with normal function in a majority of pigs postoperatively. The short duration of low SCPP suggests that hemodynamic manipulation lasting only 24-48h may allow routine complete preservation of normal cord function despite sacrifice of all SAs.

Pulmonary complications after descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair: predictors, prevention, and treatment.
Although recent advances in surgical techniques have improved outcomes of descending thoracic (DTA) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair, significant mortality and morbidity still occur. The aim of the current retrospective study is to determine predictors of postoperative pulmonary complications and prolonged hospital stay. Two hundred nineteen patients (median age, 66 years; range, 18 to 88; 112 male) underwent DTA (n = 79 [36%; 23 elephant trunk completions]) or TAAA (n = 140 [64%; Crawford I (52%), II (10%), III (11%), IV (7%); 31 elephant trunk completions]) between June 2002 and June 2005. Forty-one patients presented with ruptured aneurysms. Left atrial-to-femoral bypass was utilized in 51% of the patients. Femorofemoral bypass and distal aortic perfusion were used in 41% of the patients, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) was used in 43 patients (mean duration: 31 +/- 9 minutes); 8% were done with clamp-and-sew technique. Adverse outcomes were seen in 21 patients (9.5%); hospital death in 13 (5.9%), and stroke in 13 (5 of whom died; 5.9%). Sixty patients (27%) experienced respiratory complications with prolonged postoperative ventilation (longer than 48 hours); 24 required tracheostomy (11%). Independent predictors of pulmonary complications after DTA/TAAA were TAAA (p = 0.03), preoperative blood urea nitrogen greater than 24 mg/dL (p = 0.03) and rupture (p = 0.09). The median hospital stay was 11 days (interquartile range, 6 to 35). Independent predictors of length of hospital stay were preoperative blood urea nitrogen (p = 0.045), postoperative bleeding (p < 0.005), reintubation (p = 0.001), tracheostomy (p < 0.0005), and transfusion of platelets (p = 0.008). This contemporary experience demonstrates that preoperative renal insufficiency and extensive aneurysm are important predictors of respiratory complications after aortic aneurysm surgery.

Spinal cord perfusion and protection during descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic surgery: the collateral network concept.
In the last two decades, as an increasing number of patients with descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysms are being diagnosed and treated, a more sophisticated understanding of spinal cord perfusion has become important in the attempt to minimize the frequency of spinal cord injury. The synthesis of information from laboratory studies and clinical experience has led to the collateral network concept, a framework for understanding spinal cord perfusion and thereby improving spinal cord protection during treatment of aneurysmal disease of the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. Application of principles based on the collateral network concept has resulted in falling rates of spinal cord injury, which now approach 1% in descending thoracic aneurysm resection and less than 10% in extensive thoracoabdominal resections. These accomplishments suggest that, with further investigation, routine sacrifice of segmental aortic branches can be carried out in a way that will allow surgical and endovascular therapy of extensive distal aortic aneurysms without neurologic injury.

The fate of the distal aorta after repair of acute type A aortic dissection.
The residual aorta's behavior after repair of acute type A dissection is incompletely understood. We analyzed segmental growth rates, distal reoperation, and factors influencing long-term survival. One hundred seventy-nine consecutive patients (70% male; mean age, 60 years) with acute type A dissection underwent aggressive resection of the intimal tear and open distal anastomosis (1986-2003). Hospital mortality was 13.4%. Survivors had serial computed tomographic scans: digitization yielded distal segmental dimensions. Segment-specific average rates of enlargement and factors influencing faster growth were analyzed. Distal reoperations and patient survival were examined. Eighty-nine (57%) patients had imaging data sufficient for growth rate calculations. The median diameters after repair were as follows: aortic arch, 3.6 cm; descending aorta, 3.7 cm; and abdominal aorta, 3.2 cm. Subsequent growth rates were 0.8, 1.0, and 0.8 mm/y, respectively. Initial size of greater than 4 cm (P = .005) and initial diameter of less than 4 cm with a patent false lumen (P = .004) predicted greater growth in the descending aorta, and male sex (P = .05) significantly affected growth in the abdominal aorta. No significant factors were found for the aortic arch. There were 25 distal aortic reoperations (16 patients), and risk of reoperation was 16% at 10 years. Risk factors reducing long-term survival after repair of acute type A dissection included age (P < .0001), new neurological deficit at presentation (P = .04), absence of preoperative thrombus in the false lumen of the ascending aorta (P = .03), and a patent distal false lumen postoperatively (P = .06) but not distal reoperation. Growth of the distal aorta after repair of acute type A dissection is typically slow and linear. Distal reoperation is uncommon, and late risk of death is approximately twice that of a healthy population.

Mathematical model for describing cerebral oxygen desaturation in patients undergoing deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
Surgical treatment for aortic arch disease requiring periods of circulatory arrest is associated with a spectrum of neurological sequelae. Cerebral oximetry can non-invasively monitor patients for cerebral ischaemia even during periods of circulatory arrest. We hypothesized that cerebral desaturation during circulatory arrest could be described by a mathematical relationship that is time-dependent. Cerebral desaturation curves obtained from 36 patients undergoing aortic surgery with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) were used to create a non-linear mixed model. The model assumes that the rate of oxygen decline is greatest at the beginning before steadily transitioning to a constant. Leave-one-out cross-validation and jackknife methods were used to evaluate the validity of the predictive model. The average rate of cerebral desaturation during DHCA can be described as: Sct(o(2))[t]=81.4-(11.53+0.37 x t) (1-0.88 x exp (-0.17 x t)). Higher starting Sct(o(2)) values and taller patient height were also associated with a greater decline rate of Sct(o(2)). Additionally, a predictive model was derived after the functional form of a x log (b+c x delta), where delta is the degree of Sct(o(2)) decline after 15 min of DHCA. The model enables the estimation of a maximal acceptable arrest time before reaching an ischaemic threshold. Validation tests showed that, for the majority, the prediction error is no more than +/-3 min. We were able to create two mathematical models, which can accurately describe the rate of cerebral desaturation during circulatory arrest at 12-15 degrees C as a function of time and predict the length of arrest time until a threshold value is reached.
