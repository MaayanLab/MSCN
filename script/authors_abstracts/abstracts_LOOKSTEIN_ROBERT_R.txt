Use of splenic artery embolization to relieve tense ascites following liver transplantation in a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
Recurrent venous thrombosis following liver transplantation for Budd-Chiari syndrome is common, particularly in the setting of an underlying myeloproliferative disorder. We describe a patient who developed refractory ascites due to portal vein thrombosis following liver transplantation for Budd-Chiari syndrome in the setting of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Extensive portal vein thrombosis, dense abdominal adhesions, and portosystemic collaterals precluded the use of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt or surgical portosystemic shunt to manage the patient's ascites. Splenic artery embolization to decrease portal hypertension was performed, and this resulted in complete resolution of ascites. This case demonstrates the successful use of splenic artery embolization to manage ascites due to portal vein thrombosis following liver transplantation. Splenic artery embolization may be considered as an alternative option for the management of refractory ascites due to portal hypertension in patients who are unable to undergo safe transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt or surgical shunt placement.
