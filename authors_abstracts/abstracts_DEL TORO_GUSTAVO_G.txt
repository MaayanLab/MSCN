Rhizomucor variabilis var. regularior and Hormographiella aspergillata infections in a leukemic bone marrow transplant recipient with refractory neutropenia.
Rhizomucor variabilis and Hormographiella aspergillata rarely cause human infections. This report details a fatal case of a 14-year-old female with leukemia posthematopoietic cell transplant and relapse with refractory pancytopenia. The patient first developed an R. variabilis var. regularior palate infection and later developed a cutaneous H. aspergillata infection while on posaconazole and caspofungin therapy.

Cutaneous toxoplasmosis histologically mimicking graft-versus-host disease.
The dermatology service is frequently consulted to assess cutaneous eruptions after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We describe a case of cutaneous toxoplasmosis in a stem cell transplant patient where toxoplasmosis trophozoites elicited a reaction pattern mimicking an interface dermatitis. At first blush, these findings may be misinterpreted as either a reaction to a drug or graft-versus-host disease. We hope that this case will prove helpful for dermatopathologists in asserting the correct diagnosis of cutaneous toxoplasmosis-if left untreated or treated incorrectly, this disease has a dismal prognosis.
