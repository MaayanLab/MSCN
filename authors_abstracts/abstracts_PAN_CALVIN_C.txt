Pregnancy-related liver diseases.
Liver diseases related to pregnancy may be associated with preeclampsia (liver dysfunction related to preeclampsia; hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets with or without preeclampsia [HELLP syndrome]; and acute fatty liver of pregnancy) or may not involve preeclampsia (hyperemesis gravidarum and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy). Liver diseases associated with pregnancy have unique presentations, but it can be difficult differentiating these from liver diseases that occur coincidentally with pregnancy. Recently, advances have been made in the disease mechanism and intervention of pregnancy-related liver diseases. Early diagnosis and delivery remains the key element in managing the liver diseases associated with preeclampsia, but emerging data suggest that incorporating advance supportive management into current strategies can improve both maternal and fetal outcomes.
