Non-synonymous variants in the AMACR gene are associated with schizophrenia.
The AMACR gene is located in the schizophrenia susceptibility locus on chromosome 5p13, previously identified in a large Puerto Rican pedigree of Spanish origin. The AMACR-encoded protein is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of branched-chain fatty and bile acids. The enzyme deficiency causes structural and functional brain changes, and disturbances in fatty acid and oxidative phosphorylation pathways observed in individuals with schizophrenia. Therefore, AMACR is both a positional and functional candidate gene for susceptibility to schizophrenia. The study had a two-step design: we performed mutation analysis of the coding and flanking regions of AMACR in affected members of the pedigree, and tested the detected sequence variants for association with schizophrenia in a Puerto Rican case-control sample (n=383) of Spanish descent. We identified three missense variants segregating with the disorder in the family, rs2278008, rs2287939 and rs10941112. Two of them, rs2278008 and rs2287939, demonstrated significant differences in genotype (P = 4 × 10-4, P = 4 × 10-4) and allele (P = 1 × 10-4, P = 9.5 × 10-5) frequencies in unrelated male patients compare to controls, with the odds ratios (OR) 2.24 (95% CI: 1.48-3.40) and 2.25 (95% CI: 1.49-3.38), respectively. The G-C-G haplotype of rs2278008-rs2287939-rs10941112 revealed the most significant association with schizophrenia (P = 4.25 × 10-6, OR = 2.96; 95% CI: 1.85-4.76) in male subjects. There were no statistically significant differences in genotype, allele, and haplotype frequencies between female schizophrenia subjects and controls. Our results suggest that AMACR may play a significant role in susceptibility to schizophrenia in male patients.

Mutation analysis of the C1QTNF3 gene in patients with schizophrenia.
We previously identified a small region on chromosome 5p13 related to schizophrenia in a Puerto Rican pedigree. We screened one of the positional candidate genes, C1QTNF3, for mutations in affected family members. The direct sequencing identified 10 sequence variants, including five shared by all affected family members. Genotyping of the shared variants in a Puerto Rican sample of 118 cases and 136 controls did not reveal either allelic or genotype association with schizophrenia.

Polyspike and waves do not predict generalized tonic-clonic seizures in childhood absence epilepsy.
About 40% of children with childhood absence epilepsy develop generalized tonic-clonic seizures. It is commonly held that polyspike-wave pattern on the electroencephalogram (EEG) can predict this development of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. However, there is no firm evidence in support of this proposition. To test this assumption, we used survival analysis and compared the incidence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures in 115 patients with childhood absence epilepsy having either isolated 3-Hz spike-wave or coexisting 3 Hz and polyspike-waves and other variables. There was no evidence that polyspike-waves predicted development of generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with childhood absence epilepsy. Later age of onset (> or =8 years) and family histories of generalized tonic-clonic seizures were the only independent predictors. These results have implications for counseling and in the choice of first-line antiepileptic drugs used for childhood absence epilepsy, especially if valproate is chosen based on the observation of polyspike-waves.
