Tension pneumothorax and cardiac arrest from an improvised oxygen delivery system.
An improvised mechanism for delivering supplemental oxygen to a spontaneously breathing, tracheally intubated patient set the stage for a case of barotrauma, bilateral tension pneumothorax, and cardiovascular collapse. Diagnosis and treatment was delayed by failed needle decompression of the pneumothoraces. Recommendations are made regarding the prevention and treatment of this complication to improve patient safety.
