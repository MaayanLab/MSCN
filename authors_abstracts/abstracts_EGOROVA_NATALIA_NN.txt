Effect of gender on long-term survival after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair based on results from the Medicare national database.
OBJECTIVES: Historically, women have higher procedurally related mortality rates than men for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Although endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has improved these rates for men and women, effects of gender on long-term survival with different types of AAA repair, such as EVAR vs open aneurysm repair (OAR), need further investigation. To address this issue, we analyzed survival in matched cohorts who received EVAR or OAR for both elective (eAAA) and ruptured AAA (rAAA). METHODS: Using the Medicare Beneficiary Database (1995-2006), we compiled a cohort of patients who underwent OAR or EVAR for eAAA (n = 322,892) or rAAA (n = 48,865). Men and women were matched by propensity scores, accounting for baseline demographics, comorbid conditions, treating institution, and surgeon experience. Frailty models were used to compare long-term survival of the matched groups. RESULTS: Perioperative mortality for eAAAs was significantly lower among EVAR vs OAR recipients for both men (1.84% vs 4.80%) and women (3.19% vs 6.37%, P < .0001). One difference, however, was that the survival benefit of EVAR was sustained for the 6 years of follow-up in women but disappeared in 2 years in men. Similarly, the survival benefit of men vs women after elective EVAR disappeared after 1.5 to 2 years. For rAAAs, 30-day mortality was significantly lower for EVAR recipients compared with OAR recipients, for both men (33.43% vs 43.70% P < .0001) and women (41.01% vs 48.28%, P = .0201). Six-year survival was significantly higher for men who received EVAR vs those who received OAR (P = .001). However, the survival benefit for women who received EVAR compared with OAR disappeared in 6 months. Survival was also substantially higher for men than women after emergent EVAR (P = .0007). CONCLUSIONS: Gender disparity is evident from long-term outcomes after AAA repair. In the case for rAAA, where the long-term outcome for women was significantly worse than for men, the less invasive EVAR treatment did not appear to benefit women to the same extent that it did for men. Although the long-term outcome after open repair for elective AAA was also worse for women, EVAR benefit for women was sustained longer than for men. These associations require further study to isolate specific risk factors that would be potential targets for improving AAA management.

Development of a novel scoring tool for the identification of large ?5 cm abdominal aortic aneurysms.
Current screening recommendations for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) target >3-cm diameter aneurysms in ever-smoking 65- to 75-year-old males. However, more than 50% of AAA ruptures occur in individuals outside this patient cohort, and only a subset of AAAs detected are large enough to warrant surgery. In this analysis, we evaluated more than 3 million screened individuals and developed a scoring tool to identify ?5-cm diameter AAAs in the entire population at risk. Between 2003 and 2008, demographics and risk factors were collected from 3.1 million people undergoing ultrasound screening for AAA by Life Line Screening, Inc. Using multivariable logistic regression analysis, we identified risk factors and developed a scoring system to predict the presence of ?5-cm diameter AAAs. Smoking had a profound influence on the risk of AAA, which increased with number of cigarettes smoked and years of smoking, and decreased following smoking cessation. Novel findings included a protective effect of exercise, normal weight, and Black/Hispanic race/ethnicity. Using these and other factors, the scoring system provided good predictive accuracy (C-statistic = 0.82), when tested against the validation subset of the study cohort. The model predicts the presence of 121,000 ?5 cm AAA in the US population (prevalence: 0.14%). Demonstrating the inadequacy of the current screening recommendations, only 35% of these aneurysms were among males aged 65 to 75 years. Based on the largest cohort of patients ever screened for AAA, we developed a screening strategy that can identify large AAAs in a broad population of individuals at risk.

Lessons learned from the analysis of gender effect on risk factors and procedural outcomes of lower extremity arterial disease.
Despite overall improvement, there is still a gender-related disparity in the outcomes of lower extremities peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We analyzed sex-related variability among factors that are known to influence outcomes. Data on PAD inpatient hospitalizations from New York, New Jersey, and Florida state hospital discharge databases (1998-2007) were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Of the 372,692 surgical hospitalizations identified, 162,730 (43.66%) involved women. Men and women undergoing vascular procedures differed in that more men smoked (18% vs 14%; P<.0001), and more men had coronary artery disease (40% vs 33%; P<.0001). Women were more likely to be obese (11.86% vs 4.89%; P<.0001), black (18.81% vs 12.66%; P<.0001), older, and have critical limb ischemia (CLI) (39.41% vs 37.67%; P<.0001). They had higher mortality (5.26% vs 4.21%; P<.0001) and complication rates, especially bleeding (10.62 % vs 8.19%; P<.0001) and infection (3.23% vs 2.88%; P<.0001). Mortality rates after endovascular procedures were lower and showed marginal difference between genders (2.87% vs 2.11%; P<.0001). The difference was more pronounced after open revascularizations (5.05% for women vs 4.00% for men; P<.0001) and amputations (9.82% for women vs 8.82% for men; P<.0001). Bleeding differences between men and women were greatest when both open and endovascular procedures were done during the same hospitalizations and lowest after major amputations. Similar to bleeding, transgender differences in postoperative infections were more pronounced after combination of open and endovascular procedures. Using a multivariable model, female gender remained a predictor of perioperative mortality, infection, and bleeding after vascular intervention (odds ratios 1.15, 1.21, and 1.32, respectively). Female gender negatively influenced the mortality of patients with cerebrovascular and coronary disease and those of black race even after adjusting for relevant clinical and demographic risk factors. Gender effect on mortality dissipated in octogenarians and patients with claudication. Female gender continues to be an important risk factor that negatively influences the outcomes of vascular interventions; however, these effects vary between different high-risk groups and procedures. Gender effect on mortality dissipates in elderly patients. Prompt recognition of the associations between gender and various risk factors of cardiovascular disease and aggressive modification of these risk factors in female patients may improve gender-related disparity in the outcomes of vascular disease.

An analysis of the outcomes of a decade of experience with lower extremity revascularization including limb salvage, lengths of stay, and safety.
Demographic and practice modality changes during the past decade have led to a substantial shift in the management of peripheral vascular disease. This study examined the effect of these changes using large national and regional data sets on procedure type, indications, morbidity, and on the primary target outcome: limb salvage. National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data sets and New York (NY) State inpatient hospitalizations and outpatient surgeries discharge databases from 1998 through 2007 were used to identify hospitalizations for lower extremity revascularization (LER) and major amputations. Patients were selected by cross-referencing diagnostic and procedural codes. Proportions were analyzed by chi(2) analysis, continuous variables by t test, and trends by the Poisson regression. The national per capita (100,000 population, age >40 years) volume of major amputations decreased by 38%. The volume for national and regional use of endovascular LER doubled. The volume of open LER decreased by 67% from 1998 through 2007. Ambulatory endovascular LER grew in NY State from 7 per capita in 1998 to 22 in 2007. Interventions declined by 20% (93 to 75) for critical limb ischemia (CLI) but increased by nearly 50% for claudication. Outpatient data analysis revealed a fivefold increase in vascular interventions for CLI and claudication. Nationally, endovascular LER interventions quadrupled (8% to 32%) for CLI and doubled (26% to 61%) for claudication. A parallel reduction occurred in major amputations for patients with CLI (42% to 30%), for other PAD diagnoses (18% to 14%), and for claudication (0.9% to 0.3%). Although surgical interventions for CLI declined significantly for octogenarians from 317 to 240, outpatient interventions increased for CLI, claudication, and other diagnoses in all age groups. Comorbidities for patients treated in 2006 were substantially greater than those of a decade ago. For most procedures, cardiac and bleeding complications have significantly decreased during the last decade. Length of stay (LOS) declined from 9.5 to 7.6 days and the percentage of short (1-2 day) hospitalizations increased from 16% to 35%. Although patients today, whether treated for claudication or CLI, have more comorbidities, the rates of amputation, the procedural morbidity and mortality, and LOS have all significantly decreased. Other variables, including changes in medical management and wound care, undoubtedly are important, but this change appears to be largely due to the widespread and successful use of endovascular LER or to earlier intervention, or both, driven by the safety of these techniques.

Process of care events in transplantation: effects on the cost of hospitalization.
Deviations in the processes of healthcare delivery that affect patient outcomes are recognized to have an impact on the cost of hospitalization. Whether deviations that do not affect patient outcome affects cost has not been studied. We have analyzed process of care (POC) events that were reported in a large transplantation service (n = 3,012) in 2005, delineating whether or not there was a health consequence of the event and assessing the impact on hospital resource utilization. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for patient differences. The rate of POC events varied by transplanted organ: from 10.8 per 1000 patient days (kidney) to 17.3 (liver). The probability of a POC event increased with severity of illness. The majority (81.5%) of the POC events had no apparent effect on patients' health (63.6% no effect and 17.9% unknown). POC events were associated with longer length of stay (LOS) and higher costs independent of whether there was a patient health impact. Multiple events during the same hospitalization were associated with the highest impact on LOS and cost. POC events in transplantation occur frequently, more often in sicker patients and, although the majority of POC events do not harm the patient, their effect on resource utilization is significant.
