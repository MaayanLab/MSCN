Fatigue in rheumatologic diseases.
Today, fatigue still remains an under-reported symptom in rheumatologic diseases, infrequently addressed by patient and physician. Although not all of the causes of fatigue in rheumatologic diseases have been fully elucidated, recognizing the multifactorial components is essential in formulating targeted, effective treatment strategies. Deconstructing rheumatologic diseases into discrete symptoms such as fatigue in an effort to identify specific causes and formulate targeted treatments remains a daunting task. High-quality RCTs will be required to evaluate the effectiveness of combined pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies, which empirically appear to be the most promising. To date, this research is lacking.
