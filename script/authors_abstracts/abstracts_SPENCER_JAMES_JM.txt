Case series: evaluation of a liquid silicone gel on scar appearance following excisional surgery--a pilot study.
Efforts to improve the size and appearance of scars have included therapies as varied as laser treatments and onion extract gels. Silicone gel sheeting is well know to improve the appearance of hypertrophic scars, and may have a role in the management of routine surgical and traumatic scars. By varying the degree of cross linking, silicone elastomer can be a solid sheet or a liquid gel. In this pilot series, seven patients applied a liquid silicone gel twice a day to one half of a new surgical scar for three months. At the end of this time, the treated side was noticeably better in appearance in five of seven patients while two of seven had no difference. In no patient was the silicone treated side worse in appearance.
