Alkaline phosphatase variation during carfilzomib treatment is associated with best response in multiple myeloma patients.
The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates bone formation through osteoblast differentiation. We analyzed variation alkaline phosphatase (ALP) during carfilzomib treatment. Data from 38 patients enrolled in the PX-171-003 and 29 patients in PX-171-004 studies, for patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma, were analyzed. All patients received 20?mg/m(2) of carfilzomib on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of a 28-day cycle. Sixty-seven patients from ALP data were evaluable. In PX-171-003, the ORR (>PR) was 18% and the clinical benefit response (CBR; >MR) was 26%, while in PX-171-004, the ORR was 35.5% overall and 57% in bortezomib-naive patients. ALP increment from baseline was statistically different in patients who achieved ?VGPR compared with all others on Days 1 (P?=?0.0049) and 8 (P?=?0.006) of Cycle 2. In patients achieving a VGPR or better, ALP increased more than 15 units per liter at Cycle 2 Day 1 over baseline. An ALP increase over the same period of time was seen in 26%, 13% and 11% of patients achieving PR, MR, and SD, respectively. This retrospective analysis of patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma treated with single-agent carfilzomib indicates that early elevation in ALP is associated with subsequent myeloma response.

Proteasome inhibition and its therapeutic potential in multiple myeloma.
Due to an unmet clinical need for treatment, the first in class proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, moved from drug discovery to FDA approval in multiple myeloma in an unprecedented eight years. In the wake of this rapid approval arose a large number of questions about its mechanism of action and toxicity as well as its ultimate role in the treatment of this disease. In this article, we briefly review the preclinical and clinical development of the drug as the underpinning for a systematic review of the large number of clinical trials that are beginning to shed some light on the full therapeutic potential of bortezomib in myeloma. We conclude with our current understanding of the mechanism of action of this agent and a discussion of the novel proteasome inhibitors under development, as it will be progress in these areas that will ultimately determine the true potential of proteasome inhibition in myeloma.
