Vaccination as a triggering event for autoimmune hepatitis.
The pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis entails complex interactions between triggering factors, autoantigens, genetic predisposition, and immunoregulatory networks. Implicated triggering factors are numerous and include toxins, medications, and infectious agents. In this article, we present a unique case of a 31-year-old woman with severe autoimmune hepatitis apparently abruptly triggered by vaccination. All evidence suggests this was an idiosyncratic response to either hepatitis A or yellow fever vaccination.
