Introducing INSPIRE, a scholarly component in undergraduate medical education.
Individualized learning is a fundamental tenet of the Carnegie Foundation's new recommendations for physician training. A primary goal of Mount Sinai School of Medicine's new curriculum is to train self-directed physicians who have mastered lifelong learning skills. The Individual Scholarly Project and Independent Research Experience (INSPIRE) was created to enable fourth-year students to conduct mentored, independent scholarly projects to develop critical thinking skills and intellectual independence. Four students were accepted into the 2008 12-week pilot. Two did clinical research, 1 conducted medical education research, and 1 continued a basic science project. INSPIRE featured weekly sessions in which students shared their progress, heard about the careers of physician-scientists, and participated in presentation skills workshops. Mentors gave feedback using a form based on the program goals. Anonymous evaluations showed that all participants believed their goals were successfully fulfilled, that the likelihood of including research in their careers increased, and that they felt more skilled at writing abstracts and presenting their work orally. Students agreed that INSPIRE was a valuable opportunity for acquiring in-depth knowledge on a topic and building research and presentation skills. Helping students shape an individualized scholarly experience may help to produce doctors who are self-directed, are personally fulfilled, are able to serve society with diverse expertise, and have the tools to become leaders in their fields.
