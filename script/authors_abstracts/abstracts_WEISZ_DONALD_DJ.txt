Botulinum toxin dilution and endplate targeting in spasticity: a double-blind controlled study.
To determine the effects of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BTX-A) dilution and endplate-targeting in spastic elbow flexors. Double blind randomized controlled trial; 4-month follow-up after a 160-unit injection of BTX-A into spastic biceps brachii (4 sites). Randomization into: group 1: 100 mouse units (MU)/mL dilution, 0.4cc/site, 4-quadrant injection; group 2: 100MU/mL dilution, 0.4cc/site, 4 sites along endplate band; group 3: 20MU/mL dilution, 2cc/site, 4-quadrant injection (n=7 per group). Institutional tertiary care ambulatory clinic. Referred sample of 21 adults with spastic hemiparesis. No participant withdrew due to adverse effects. A 160-unit injection of BTX-A of different dilutions and locations into biceps brachii. Primary: agonist and antagonist (cocontraction) mean rectified voltage (MRV) of elbow flexors/extensors during maximal isometric flexion/extension; secondary: maximal voluntary power of elbow flexion/extension; spasticity angle and grade in elbow flexors/extensors (Tardieu Scale); active range of elbow extension/flexion. BTX-A injection overall reduced agonist flexor MRV (-47.5%, P<0.0001), antagonist flexor MRV (-12%, P=.037), antagonist extensor MRV (-19%, P<.01), flexion maximal voluntary power (-33%, P<.001), elbow flexor spasticity angle (-30%, P<.001) and grade (-17%, P=.03), and increased extension maximal voluntary power (24%, P=.037) and active range of elbow extension (5.5%, 8 degrees , P=.002). Agonist and antagonist flexor MRV reductions in group 3 (-81% and -31%) were greater than in groups 1 and 2, whereas increase in active range of elbow extension was greater in group 2 (10%) than in groups 1 and 3 (P<.05, analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]). Elbow flexor spasticity was significantly reduced in groups 2 and 3 only (P<.05, ANCOVA). In spastic biceps, high-volume or endplate-targeted BTX-A injections achieve greater neuromuscular blockade, cocontraction and spasticity reduction, and active range of elbow extension improvement, than low volume, nontargeted injections.

Spinal cord blood flow and ischemic injury after experimental sacrifice of thoracic and abdominal segmental arteries.
Spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) after sacrifice of thoracoabdominal aortic segmental arteries (TAASA) during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair remains poorly understood. This study explored SCBF for 72 h after sacrifice of all TAASA. Fourteen juvenile Yorkshire pigs underwent complete serial TAASA sacrifice (T4-L5). Six control pigs underwent anesthesia and cooling to 32 degrees C with no TAASA sacrifice. In the experimental animals, spinal cord function was continuously monitored using motor evoked potentials (MEPs) until 1h after clamping the last TAASA. Fluorescent microspheres enabled segmental measurement of SCBF along the entire spinal cord before, and 5 min, 1 h, 5 h, 24 h and 72 h after complete TAASA sacrifice. A modified Tarlov score was obtained for 3 days after surgery. All the pigs with complete TAASA sacrifice retained normal cord function (MEP) until 1h after TAASA ligation. Seven pigs (50%) with complete TAASA sacrifice recovered after 72 h; seven pigs suffered paraparesis or paraplegia. Intraoperatively, and until 1h postoperatively, SCBF was similar among the three groups along the entire cord. Postoperatively, SCBF did not decrease in any group, but significant hyperemia occurred at 5h in controls and recovery animals, but did not occur in pigs that developed paraparesis or paraplegia in the T8-L2 segments (p=0.0002) and L3-S segments (p=0.0007). At 24h, SCBF remained marginally lower from T8 caudally; at 72h, SCBF was similar among all groups along the entire cord. SCBF in the segments T8-L2 at 5h predicted functional recovery (p=0.003). This study suggests that critical spinal cord ischemia after complete TAASA sacrifice does not occur immediately (intraoperatively), but is delayed 1-5h or longer after clamping, and represents failure to mount a hyperemic response to rewarming and awakening. The short duration of low SCBF associated with spinal cord injury suggests that hemodynamic and metabolic manipulation lasting only 24-72 h may allow routine preservation of normal cord function despite sacrifice of all TAASA secondary to surgical or endovascular repair of large TAAA.

Spinal cord perfusion after extensive segmental artery sacrifice: can paraplegia be prevented?
Understanding the ability of the paraspinal anastomotic network to provide adequate spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP) critical for both surgical and endovascular repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA). To monitor pressure in the collateral circulation, a catheter was inserted into the distal end of the divided first lumbar segmental artery (SA) of 10 juvenile Yorkshire pigs (28.9+/-3.8kg). SA pairs from T3 through L5 were serially sacrificed at 32 degrees C; SCPP and function - using motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) - were continuously monitored until 1h after clamping the last SA. Intermittent aortic and SCPP monitoring was continued for 5 days postoperatively, along with evaluation of motor function. A mean of 14.4+/-0.7 SAs were sacrificed without loss of MEP. SCPP (mmHg) dropped from 68+/-7 before SA clamping (77% of aortic pressure) to 22+/-6 at end clamping, and 21+/-4 after 1h, reaching its lowest point - 19+/-4 - after 5h. Postoperatively, SCPP recovered to 33+/-6 at 24h; 42+/-10 at 48h; 56+/-14 at 72h; 62+/-15 at 96h, returning to baseline (63+/-20) at 120h. Despite comparable SCPP patterns, four pigs did not fully regain the ability to stand. Six animals recovered: two could stand and four could walk. Interruption of all SAs at 32 degrees C in this pig model results in a spectrum of cord injury, with normal function in a majority of pigs postoperatively. The short duration of low SCPP suggests that hemodynamic manipulation lasting only 24-48h may allow routine complete preservation of normal cord function despite sacrifice of all SAs.
