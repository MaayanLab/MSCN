Communicable and Non-Communicable Diseases Among Recent Immigrants with Implications for Primary care; a Comprehensive Immigrant Health Approach.
Data on health status of immigrants and practice recommendations for providers are scarce. We evaluated 99 recent immigrants from developing nations in an immigrant clinic in New York City to assess epidemiology of diseases and to recommend potential screening. Providers received ongoing training. Majority patient was from West Africa and Central America with a mean of 2.1 years in the US. Two thirds were uninsured. Half had positive PPD. Half had prior hepatitis B infection, which was higher in Africans. One quarter had intestinal parasites. Two thirds were overweight; 33% had hypercholesterolemia, 26% were hypertensive, and 25% of women had a Pap smear previously. Eosinophila was higher in African and males (P < 0.05) but didn't predict stool O&P. Recent immigrants were at risk for chronic non-communicable diseases, similar to the US population. Providers should balance their focus on communicable and non-communicable diseases. We recommend practice-based training and on-site comprehensive health services.
