Aortic valve vegetation without endocarditis.
We present a 30-year-old man with an acute middle cerebral artery territory infarction. A transesophageal echocardiogram showed a large, highly mobile mass attached to the patient's aortic valve. We discuss the differential diagnosis of a cardiac mass that includes infection, tumor, and thrombus. A complete workup showed no evidence of systemic infection but did reveal the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. The patient also had a history of a right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. Anticoagulation therapy was started, and follow-up showed complete resolution of the aortic valve lesion. This case highlights that when a valvular vegetation is encountered in a clinical setting that does not suggest infectious endocarditis, the diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome should be considered. This case and our review of the literature suggest that vegetations in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, no matter how large and ominous in appearance, can be treated successfully with anticoagulation and vigilant observation.

Multimodal characterization of a large right atrial mass after surgical repair of an atrial septal defect.
A 43-year-old woman with exertional dyspnea and a history of surgically repaired atrial septal defect was referred for a transthoracic echocardiogram, which demonstrated a large, mobile mass in her right atrium. The mass was further characterized with contrast transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and delayed enhancement MRI, which together suggested a thrombus, attached to the eustachian valve and prolapsing through the tricuspid valve. The mass was resected and the diagnosis confirmed on histopathologic examination. This case illustrates the utility of a multimodal approach in characterizing cardiac masses.
