The effect of low body mass index on the development of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia.
To evaluate the relationship between low maternal body mass index (BMI) as calculated in the first trimester and the risk of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension. Patients enrolled in the First And Second Trimester Evaluation of Risk for aneuploidy (FASTER) trial were grouped into three weight categories: low BMI (BMI <19.8 kg/m2), normal BMI (BMI 19.8 - 26 kg/m2), and overweight BMI (26.1 - 29 kg/m2). The incidences of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia were ascertained for each group. Tests for differences in crude incidence proportions were performed using Chi-square tests. Multiple logistic regression was used to adjust for maternal age, race, parity, obesity, use of assisted reproductive technology (ART), in vitro fertilization (IVF), gestational diabetes, pre-gestational diabetes, cocaine use, and smoking. The proportion of patients having gestational hypertension in the low BMI group was 2.0% compared to 3.2% for normal BMI and 6.0% for overweight BMI (p < 0.0001). Women with low BMI were also less likely to develop preeclampsia, 1.1% vs. 1.9% for normal BMI and 2.8% for overweight BMI (p < 0.0001). We found that women with low BMI in the first trimester were significantly less likely to develop gestational hypertension or preeclampsia than women with a normal BMI.

Does sonographic determination of placental location predict fetal birth weight in diamniotic-dichorionic twins?
The purpose of this study was to determine the association between placental location in diamniotic-dichorionic twins as determined at the time of anatomic survey and birth weight. We retrospectively identified all diamniotic-dichorionic twins in our Maternal-Fetal Medicine sonography database between 2000 and 2005 who had an anatomic survey, went on to be delivered at our hospital, and had records available for review (n = 304). Placental location for each twin was determined at the time of anatomic survey and grouped into both anterior or both posterior versus separate anterior and posterior. Maternal and fetal characteristics were collected from chart review. Placental pathologic findings were available for 249 (83%) patients. Outcomes analyzed were percent discordance, small size for gestational age of twin A or B, and difference in birth weight as a continuous variable. Multivariable logistic regression using stepwise backward elimination was used to adjust for potential confounders. There was no difference in discordance of 20% or greater or incidence of small size for gestational age when both placentas were both anterior and both posterior compared with separate anterior and posterior: adjusted odds ratio (AdjOR), 1.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-2.95); and AdjOR, 1.29 (95% CI, 0.57-2.89). The actual birth weight difference (A - B) was not affected by placental location (P = .36). Opposite sex fetuses and nulliparity were significantly associated with birth weight discordance: AdjOR, 2.68 (95% CI, 1.39-5.17); and AdjOR, 0.34 (95% CI, 0.28-0.94). We did not find a correlation between birth weight and placental location in our cohort analysis. The presence of sex-discordant twins was associated with birth weight discordance of 20% or greater, whereas nulliparity was protective.
