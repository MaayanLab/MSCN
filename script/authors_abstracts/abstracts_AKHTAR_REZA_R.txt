Colonoscopy versus computed tomography colonography for colorectal cancer screening.
Colorectal cancer is second only to lung cancer as the leading cause of death among North Americans of both sexes. Although screening rates for colorectal cancer in the United States have increased over the past decade, these rates (in the range of 45%-60%) are still lower than the screening rates for breast cancer (approximately 80%).

This article compares the 2 methods with respect to both advantages and disadvantages.
