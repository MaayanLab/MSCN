Three-dimensional imaging improves surgical performance for both novice and experienced operators using the da Vinci Robot System.
This study was designed to evaluate the impact of 3-dimensional vision on the performance of resident and experienced surgeons using the da Vinci Robot System (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA). Four tasks were performed by 12 surgeons with varying experience. Performance times and errors were recorded using both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional vision for each task. Performance time and error rates for all 4 skills confirm a significant advantage using 3-dimensional vision. Performance times were reduced by 34% to 46% using 3-dimensional imaging for all participants with statistical significance. Error rates were reduced by 44% and 66%. Independent of the biomechanical advantages of the da Vinci Robot System, 3-dimensional vision allows for significant improvement in performance times and error rates for both inexperienced residents and advanced laparoscopic surgeons.
