Loop electrosurgical excision procedure to treat cervical stenosis at the time of surgical abortion.
Cervical stenosis can act as a barrier to the uterine cavity for surgical abortion. We present a case in which a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) was performed during a surgical abortion to overcome a stenotic cervix. We also discuss risk factors for cervical stenosis, and other methods of treating stenosis which have been reported in the literature.
