Spinal Cord Preservation in Thoracoabdominal Aneurysm Repair.
Spinal cord injury (SCI) stands as one of the most dreadful complications of thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair. Despite the less invasive nature and recent technical advancements of endovascular aortic repair, SCI still remains a significant danger in endovascular approaches. However, as our understanding of the collateral network of spinal cord vasculature has grown, it has become evident that the incidence of paraplegia and paraparesis in conjunction with endovascular procedures can be minimized through the use of many of the same strategies that have proven successful in reducing SCI associated with open surgical repair. This article highlights important aspects of spinal cord protection, which have been derived from the authors' clinical and experimental experience.

The Bentall procedure: is it the gold standard? A series of 597 consecutive cases.
We compared aortic root reconstructions using conduits with biological valves and mechanical valves. Of 597 patients (1995-2008), 307 (mean age 71 years [23-89 years]) had biological valves and 290 (mean age 51 years [21-82 years]) had mechanical valves. The subgroup of 242 patients aged 50 to 70 years included 133 with biological and 109 with mechanical valves. Overall hospital mortality was 3.9% with biological valves (n = 15; elective: 3.7% [n = 10]) versus 2.8% with mechanical valves (n = 8; elective: 1.4% [n = 3]). In patients 50 to 70 years, age greater than 65 years (relative risk: 3.3 [P = .0001]), clot (relative risk: 2.5 [P = .05]), coronary artery disease (relative risk:3.5 [P < .0001]), and degenerative etiology (relative risk: 0.4 [P = .006]) were independent risk factors for long-term survival (after postoperative day 30); there was no difference in long-term survival between biological and mechanical valves (relative risk: 0.9 [P = .74]). The linearized rate for valve/ascending aorta reoperation was 0.86%/pt-y (2 in 2310 pt-y) after mechanical valves and 2.5%/pt-y (4 in 1586 pt-y) after Bentall procedures with the biological valve. The choice of valve for aortic root reconstruction seems to have no influence on long-term outcome. Emergency operation and the presence of clot/atheroma have a significant impact on short-term outcome. Reoperation for either ascending aorta and/or aortic valve is low.

Predicting the risk of paraplegia after thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair.
Endovascular repair of descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms is an appealing alternative to the standard surgical approach, but precludes revascularization of segmental arteries (SAs). For safer surgical and endovascular repairs, an accurate prediction of the risk of paraplegia in relation to the extent of SA sacrifice is needed. From January 1994 to October 2008, 609 patients (mean age, 63 ± 14 years) underwent surgical descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair without SA reimplantation. Three hundred seventy-six patients (62%) were male; 159 (26%) had urgent or emergent operation; 199 (33%) had previous aortic surgery. Somatosensory- or motor-evoked potential monitoring and cerebrospinal fluid drainage were routinely performed. Hospital mortality was 10.7% (65 patients). Spinal cord injury (SCI) occurred in 3.4% (21 patients). The extent of resection-expressed as the number of SAs sacrificed (p = 0.007)-and the need for visceral artery reimplantation (p = 0.03) were independent risk factors for paraplegia. Further analysis identified four risk groups (p < 0.0001): fewer than 8 SAs sacrificed (group A, SCI = 1.2%); sacrifice of 8 to 12 SAs with proximal origin in the upper thorax (group B, SCI = 3.7%); 8 to 12 SAs sacrificed beginning in the lower thorax (group C, SCI = 15.4%); and 13 or more SAs sacrificed (group D, SCI = 12.5%). This four-group model more accurately predicts SCI risk than the Crawford classification (goodness of fit c statistic: 0.748 versus 0.640). The extent of SA sacrifice is the most powerful predictor of paraplegia risk. For aneurysms of moderate extent, a more distal location involving the abdominal aorta increases the risk of spinal cord injury. Sacrifice of fewer than 8 SAs is associated with a very low paraplegia risk regardless of location.

Experimental two-stage simulated repair of extensive thoracoabdominal aneurysms reduces paraplegia risk.
In a pig model, we compared spinal cord injury after extensive segmental artery (SA) sacrifice in a single stage with recovery after a two-stage procedure: lumbar artery followed by thoracic SA sacrifice. Twenty juvenile Yorkshire pigs were randomly assigned to undergo extensive SA sacrifice at 32 degrees C in a single operation (group 1, n = 10), or thoracic SA ligation 7 days after lumbar artery sacrifice (group 2, n = 10). Spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP) was monitored using a catheter placed in the distal stump of L1. Hind limb function was evaluated intraoperatively using motor-evoked potentials and for 5 days postoperatively using a modified Tarlov score. Motor-evoked potentials were intact in all pigs until 1 hour after surgery. All pigs in group 2 fully recovered hind limb function, whereas 40% in group 1 experienced paraplegia (median Tarlov scores 9 versus 7; p = 0.004). Group 1 SCPP fell to 28 +/- 6 mm Hg after SA sacrifice, compared with 44 +/- 8 mm Hg in group 2 (p < 0.0001). After sacrifice of all residual SAs, SCPP in group 2 remained consistently greater than 85% of baseline, significantly higher than group 1 SCPP from end clamping until 72 hours (p = 0.0002). Histopathologic analysis showed more severe ischemic damage to the lower thoracic (p < 0.001) and lumbar spinal cord (p = 0.01) in group 1. In contrast with the single-stage approach, a two-stage procedure, starting with ligation of six or fewer lumbar SAs, leads to only a mild drop in SCPP and stimulates vascular remodeling, minimizing the impact of subsequent SA sacrifice on spinal cord function. The greater safety of extensive SA sacrifice when undertaken in two stages has important implications for endovascular and hybrid aneurysm repair.

Extracorporeal peritoneovenous shunt for the management of postaneurysmectomy chylous ascites in a Marfan patient.
Chylous ascites is an uncommon complication after aortic and other retroperitoneal surgeries. The management is very specific to the etiology and clinical status of the patient. The mortality from chylous ascites is not negligible, and aggressive measures are often needed. A voluminous chylous ascites developed in a 38-year-old woman after an open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair that was refractive to initial therapeutic interventions. We used an extracorporeal peritoneovenous shunt to control the abdominal ascites and improve the patient's immunologic and nutritional status.

Noninvasive cerebral oxygenation may predict outcome in patients undergoing aortic arch surgery.
Surgical repair of the aortic arch remains technically challenging and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Cerebral oximetry is a noninvasive technology that can monitor the regional oxygen saturation of the frontal cortex. We hypothesized that magnitude and duration of decreased intraoperative regional oxygen saturation was associated with postoperative organ dysfunction. Additionally, we sought to identify regional oxygen saturation threshold values that are predictive of organ dysfunction. The intraoperative regional oxygen saturation values of 30 patients undergoing aortic arch surgery were recorded and analyzed. Postoperative complications were categorized as "major" and "minor." Severe adverse outcome, extubation time, intensive care unit length of stay, and hospital length of stay data were collected and compared with the integrals of regional oxygen saturation and time (area under the threshold) spent beneath predetermined absolute threshold limits. Twenty subjects underwent hemiarch replacement, and 10 subjects received total aortic arch replacements. There were 30 major and 29 minor complications identified. Sixteen (53.3%) patients had at least 1 major complication. Logistic regression showed statistically significant associations between area under the threshold and severe adverse outcome incidence for regional oxygen saturation thresholds of 60% (P = .038) and 65% (P = .025). Patients who spent more than 30 minutes under the absolute threshold of 60% had an extended hospital stay of 4 days leading to an additional cost of $8300.00. Our findings lend evidence to support the association of decreased perioperative cerebral oxygenation values with poor outcomes after aortic arch surgery.

Staged repair significantly reduces paraplegia rate after extensive thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
Paraplegia remains a devastating, and still too frequent, complication after repair of extensive thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Strategies to prevent ischemic spinal cord damage after extensive segmental artery sacrifice-or occlusion, essential for endovascular repair-are still evolving. Ninety patients who underwent extensive segmental artery sacrifice (median, 13; range, 9-15) during open surgical repair from June 1994 to December 2007 were reviewed retrospectively. Fifty-five patients (mean age, 65 +/- 12 years; 49% were male), most with extensive Crawford type II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, had a single procedure (single-stage group). Thirty-five patients (mean age, 62 +/- 14 years; 57% were male) had 2 procedures (2-stage group), usually Crawford type III or IV repair after operation for Crawford type I descending thoracic aneurysm. The median interval between the 2-stage procedures was 5 years (3 months to 17 years). There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to age, gender, cause of the aneurysm, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, urgency, previous cerebrovascular accidents, year of procedure, or cerebrospinal fluid drainage. In single-stage procedures, hypothermic circulatory arrest was used in 29% of patients, left-sided heart bypass was used in 40% of patients, and partial cardiopulmonary bypass was used in 27% of patients. Somatosensory-evoked potentials were monitored in all patients, and motor-evoked potentials were monitored in 39% of patients. Cerebrospinal fluid was drained in 84% of patients. Overall hospital mortality was 11.1%. There were no significant differences in mortality, stroke, postoperative bleeding, infection, renal failure, or pulmonary insufficiency between the groups. However, 15% of patients in the single-stage group had permanent spinal cord injury versus none in the 2-stage group (P = .02). The significantly lower rate of paraplegia and paraparesis in the 2-stage group occurred despite a significantly higher number of segmental arteries sacrificed in this group: a median of 14 (11-15) versus 12 (9-15) (P < .0001). A staged approach to extensive thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair may reduce the incidence of spinal cord injury. This is of particular importance in designing strategies involving hybrid or entirely endovascular procedures.

Long-term survival after open repair of chronic distal aortic dissection.
The optimal treatment of chronic distal aortic dissection remains controversial, with endovascular stent-graft techniques challenging traditional surgery. From January 1994 to April 2007, 104 patients (82 male, median age 60.5 years) with chronic distal aortic dissection underwent surgical repair, 0 to 21 years after initial diagnosis of acute type A or B dissection (median 2.1 years). Twenty-three (22%) patients underwent urgent-emergent surgery. Mean aortic diameter was 6.9 +/- 1.4 cm. Indications for surgery, other than aortic expansion, were pain in 6 (6%) patients, malperfusion in 6 (6%), and rupture in 11 (11%). Forty-nine (47%) had previous cardioaortic surgery (29% dissection-related), 21 (20%) had coronary artery disease, 12 (12%) had Marfan syndrome, and 4 (4%) were on chronic dialysis. Twenty-six (25%) had a thrombosed false lumen. Thirty (29%) patients required reimplantation of visceral arteries; 8.3 +/- 2.7 segmental artery pairs were sacrificed. Hospital mortality was 9.6% (10 patients). Paraplegia occurred in 5 (4.8%). Twenty-seven patients (26%) experienced adverse outcome (death within one year, paraplegia, stroke, or dialysis). Adverse outcome was associated with atheroma (p = 0.04, odds ratio = 4.3). Survival was 78% at 1, 68% at 5, and 59% at 10 years (average follow-up, 7.7 +/- 4.1 years). Freedom from distal aortic reoperation was 99% at 1, 93% at 5, and 83% at 10 years. After one year, patients enjoyed longevity equivalent to a normal age-sex matched population (standardized mortality ratio = 1.38, p = 0.23). By multivariate analysis, atheroma (p = 0.0005, relative risk = 9.32) and age (p = 0.0003, relative risk = 1.15/year) were risk factors for long-term survival. The efficacy of open repair for distal chronic dissection is highlighted by normal survival after the first year, and a low reoperation-reintervention rate.

Redo lateral thoracotomy for reoperative descending and thoracoabdominal aortic repair: a consecutive series of 60 patients.
Reoperative descending thoracic aorta (DTA) or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) surgery is a challenge because of increased risk of lung injury and diffuse bleeding. Sixty patients (34 male, mean age 54.4 years) underwent redo thoracotomy for DTA (22 patients) or extended thoracoabdominal incision for reoperative TAAA (38 patients) from March 1988 to June 2007, after 1.7 +/- 0.9 previous cardioaortic procedures. Forty-one patients were hypertensive (68%), 18 were smokers (30%), 9 had Marfan syndrome (15%), 9 had coronary artery disease (15%), 5 had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (8%), and 3 had diabetes mellitus (5%). In all, 45% (27 patients) had previous dissection, 30% (18) had atherosclerotic aneurysms, 15% had coarctation surgery (9), and 6 patients had other etiologies. Mean follow-up, 100% complete, was 6.5 years. Hospital mortality for reoperative DTA/TAAA was 13.3% (8 patients). Although 6.3 +/- 2.9 (0 to 14) segmental artery pairs were sacrificed at reoperation-and 6.2 +/- 2.3 (1 to 12) initially-for a total of 10.6 +/- 3.9 (2 to 15) segmental artery pairs sacrificed, only 1 patient had paraplegia (1.6%). Four patients had a 2-day procedure, with 12 to 24 hours of intensive care unit recovery after lysis of extensive adhesions: all survived. Respiratory complications occurred in 13 patients (21.6%), and permanent dialysis was required in 2 (3.3%), but there were no strokes. Adverse outcome-1-year mortality, stroke, permanent dialysis, or paraplegia-occurred in 13 patients (21.6%). Adverse outcome was marginally associated (p < 0.2) with increased age, atherosclerotic aneurysms (33% versus 17% other), TAA incision (30% versus 9%), and greater aneurysm extent, and was significantly associated with perfusion technique (p = 0.02). Adverse outcome occurred in 3 of 4 patients who had clamp-and-sew technique, 6 of 21 using partial cardiopulmonary bypass (28.6%), and 3 of 17 with partial left heart bypass (17.7%), but only 1 of 18 with hypothermic circulatory arrest (5.6%). Reoperative DTA/TAAA repair was significantly safer with hypothermic circulatory arrest rather than partial cardiopulmonary bypass, partial left heart bypass, or clamp-and-sew strategy. A 2-day procedure may be advisable for patients with extensive adhesions.

Aortic arch resection and ligation of the descending thoracic aorta to manage a ruptured thoracoabdominal aneurysm.
Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) are treated traditionally with open surgical repair; however, selective, high-risk patients can be evaluated for an endovascular approach. If the TAAA is complicated by the presence of aortic rupture, open surgical intervention is conventionally the course of action. However, unlike the primary operation, reoperations of TAAA might necessitate less conventional approaches. We report a patient with a previously repaired, ruptured, acute type B aortic dissection, who presents with a contained rupture of a TAAA.

Direct spinal cord perfusion pressure monitoring in extensive distal aortic aneurysm repair.
Although maintenance of adequate spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP) by the paraspinal collateral network is critical to the success of surgical and endovascular repair of descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, direct monitoring of SCPP has not previously been described. A catheter was inserted into the distal end of a ligated thoracic segmental artery (SA) (T6 to L1) in 13 patients, 7 of whom underwent descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Spinal cord perfusion pressure was recorded from this catheter before, during, and after serial SA sacrifice, in pairs, from T3 through L4, at 32 degrees C. Somatosensory and motor evoked potentials were also monitored during SA sacrifice and until 1 hour after cardiopulmonary bypass. Target mean arterial pressure was 90 mm Hg during SA sacrifice and after nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass, and 60 mm Hg during cardiopulmonary bypass. A mean of 9.8 +/- 2.6 SAs were sacrificed without somatosensory and motor evoked potential loss. Spinal cord perfusion pressure fell from 62 +/- 12 mm Hg (76% +/- 11% of mean arterial pressure) before SA sacrifice to 53 +/- 13 mm Hg (58% +/- 15% of mean arterial pressure) after SA clamping. The most significant drop occurred with initiation of nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass, reaching 29 +/- 11 mm Hg (46% +/- 18% of mean arterial pressure) before deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Spinal cord perfusion pressure recovered during rewarming to 40 +/- 14 mm Hg (51% +/- 20% of mean arterial pressure), and further within the first hour of reestablished pulsatile flow. Somatosensory and motor evoked potentials returned in all patients intraoperatively. Recovery of SCPP began intraoperatively, and in 5 patients with prolonged monitoring, continued during the first 24 hours postoperatively. All but 1 patient, who had remarkably low postoperative SCPPs and experienced paraparesis, regained normal spinal cord function. This study supports experimental data showing that SCPP drops markedly but then recovers gradually during the first several hours after extensive SA sacrifice. Direct monitoring may help prevent a fall of SCPP below levels critical for spinal cord recovery after surgery and endovascular repair of descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.

Supradiaphragmatic inferior vena cava cannulation for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
The selection of the cannulation site and the operative scheme is essential to the preoperative preparation for the repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysms. The site of cannulation will determine the mode of cardiopulmonary support and preparedness for deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. On rare occasions, optimal femoral venous access for establishing cardiopulmonary bypass is not possible. We present our experience with cannulation of the supradiaphragmatic inferior vena cava.

Reoperative aortic root and transverse arch procedures: a comparison with contemporaneous primary operations.
Long-term survival and risk factors affecting outcome after reoperative root/ascending aorta and transverse arch procedures have not been clearly described. Two hundred patients (138 male patients; age, 60 +/- 15 years) underwent reoperative root/ascending aorta (n = 100) or transverse arch (n = 100) procedures at our institution from January 1998 to December 2004 and were compared with 480 consecutive contemporaneous patients with primary procedures (323 male patients; age, 62 +/- 16 years; 335 proximal aorta and 145 transverse arch procedures). Reoperative proximal aorta procedures had a higher hospital mortality (7%) than primary root/ascending aorta procedures (3%), but there was a less dramatic difference in operative mortality after primary and reoperative arch procedures (9% vs 10%). Separate multivariable analyses of root/ascending aorta procedures and arch procedures revealed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and age to be significant risk factors for death after either procedure. In addition, an ejection fraction of less than 30% posed a significant risk for proximal aortic surgery, and diabetes and nonelective operations predicted poorer outcome after arch operations. For survivors of root/ascending aorta operations, there was no significant difference in long-term outcome between reoperations and primary procedures, with both restoring longevity to expected levels for an age- and sex-matched normal population. Patients undergoing arch operations, however, continued to have a poorer long-term outlook than their normal peers. In this series, reoperations in the transverse arch carry the same risk as primary arch procedures, but a higher operative mortality is seen with reoperative than with primary root/ascending aorta procedures. The long-term outlook is better for patients undergoing root/ascending operations than for patients undergoing aortic arch operations, with no difference in the longevity of patients undergoing primary procedures versus reoperations.

Chromium infusion reverses extreme insulin resistance in a cardiothoracic ICU patient.
Insulin resistance is common and often multifactorial in acutely critically ill patients. At our institution, glycemic control is achieved in these patients using an intravenous insulin protocol. The authors present a case in which a patient developed severe insulin resistance following surgical repair of a thoracic aorta aneurysm. Postoperatively, the patient required 2110 units of insulin over 40 hours while receiving pressors and glucocorticoids. After the administration of intravenous chromium at 3 microg/h, the blood sugar normalized and insulin therapy was discontinued. This case represents a unique approach using intravenous chromium to achieve glycemic control in a patient with extreme insulin resistance and acute critical illness. Prospective clinical trials using intravenous chromium may provide the means to optimize intensive insulin therapy for critically ill patients.

Delayed repair of acute type A aortic dissection in a patient with gastrointestinal bleeding and pulse deficit.
Acute type A aortic dissections are considered surgical emergencies because these patients are at risk for life-threatening complications. Patients who present with significant neurologic and other end-organ malperfusion may benefit from a more conservative approach. We present a patient with type A aortic dissection and concomitant mesenteric and limb ischemia.

Vascular graft replacement of the ascending and descending aorta: do Dacron grafts grow?
The tendency of Dacron vascular grafts to expand after placement in the ascending and descending thoracic aorta has been noted, but never described in detail. From 1986 to 2005, two or more computed tomography studies were obtained as part of routine postoperative surveillance in patients with Dacron grafts implanted to replace diseased aortic segments. Scans were digitized to evaluate the entire thoracic aorta. The median diameters of 547 grafts (18 to 34 mm) in the ascending (349) and descending (198) aorta were calculated from more than 2,000 postoperative computed tomography scans. In scans obtained 7 or fewer days after implantation, the median graft diameters increased from the manufacturer's measurement by 17% in the ascending aorta (n = 169; interquartile range, 11% to 21%; p < 0.0001) and 21% in the descending aorta (n = 63; interquartile range, 12% to 25%; p < 0.0001). From an initial scan within 30 days to at least one other within 18 months after implantation, ascending aorta grafts dilated further, at a median rate of 2.8% per year (n = 143; interquartile range, -2.2% to +6.9%; p = 0.0001). Descending grafts dilated less markedly: 1.1% per year (n = 80; interquartile range, -4.0% to +6.1%; p = 0.14). After 18 months, median graft expansion gradually diminished to less than 1% per year. Significant initial expansion and early growth of woven vascular Dacron grafts occurs; it is slightly different in the ascending and descending aorta. Graft expansion should be anticipated when selecting grafts for aortic valve-sparing procedures to prevent development of regurgitation, and, for endoluminal repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysms, to prevent development of type III endoleaks in the projected landing zone.

Aortic root reconstruction with a bioprosthetic valved conduit: a consecutive series of 275 procedures.
The study objective was to assess the results of aortic root reconstruction using composite conduits with stented bioprosthetic valves. A review was conducted of 275 patients (202 were male, mean age 69 +/- 11 years, range 17-88 years) who underwent aortic root replacement using conduits constructed intraoperatively from pericardial valves and impregnated Dacron grafts between September 1993 and February 2005. There were 151 patients with degenerative aneurysms and 63 patients with atherosclerotic aneurysms; 43 patients had dissections (9 acute type A), 13 patients had endocarditis, and 5 patients had other pathologic conditions. The ascending aorta alone was replaced in 154 patients, a hemiarch reconstruction was performed in 105 patients, and extensive arch reconstruction was performed in 16 patients. Hypothermic circulatory arrest and an open distal anastomosis were used in 95% of patients. Hospital mortality was 17 of 275 patients (6.2%). Four additional patients (1.5%) sustained permanent strokes. Among surviving patients, the rate of stroke was estimated as 0.85 per 100 patient-years and the rate of significant hemorrhage was estimated as 0.3 per 100 patient-years. Reoperation for valve failure occurred in only 1 patient 12 years postoperatively. Long-term survival in men was similar to that of a normal matched control population, but was significantly lower in women (P = .002). Men who recover satisfactorily after reconstruction of the aortic root with a stented bioprosthetic valved conduit (6-month survivors) enjoy long-term outcomes equivalent to that of a normal matched population; the postoperative mortality rate in women is twice that of a normal population.

Pulmonary complications after descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair: predictors, prevention, and treatment.
Although recent advances in surgical techniques have improved outcomes of descending thoracic (DTA) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair, significant mortality and morbidity still occur. The aim of the current retrospective study is to determine predictors of postoperative pulmonary complications and prolonged hospital stay. Two hundred nineteen patients (median age, 66 years; range, 18 to 88; 112 male) underwent DTA (n = 79 [36%; 23 elephant trunk completions]) or TAAA (n = 140 [64%; Crawford I (52%), II (10%), III (11%), IV (7%); 31 elephant trunk completions]) between June 2002 and June 2005. Forty-one patients presented with ruptured aneurysms. Left atrial-to-femoral bypass was utilized in 51% of the patients. Femorofemoral bypass and distal aortic perfusion were used in 41% of the patients, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) was used in 43 patients (mean duration: 31 +/- 9 minutes); 8% were done with clamp-and-sew technique. Adverse outcomes were seen in 21 patients (9.5%); hospital death in 13 (5.9%), and stroke in 13 (5 of whom died; 5.9%). Sixty patients (27%) experienced respiratory complications with prolonged postoperative ventilation (longer than 48 hours); 24 required tracheostomy (11%). Independent predictors of pulmonary complications after DTA/TAAA were TAAA (p = 0.03), preoperative blood urea nitrogen greater than 24 mg/dL (p = 0.03) and rupture (p = 0.09). The median hospital stay was 11 days (interquartile range, 6 to 35). Independent predictors of length of hospital stay were preoperative blood urea nitrogen (p = 0.045), postoperative bleeding (p < 0.005), reintubation (p = 0.001), tracheostomy (p < 0.0005), and transfusion of platelets (p = 0.008). This contemporary experience demonstrates that preoperative renal insufficiency and extensive aneurysm are important predictors of respiratory complications after aortic aneurysm surgery.

Mathematical model for describing cerebral oxygen desaturation in patients undergoing deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
Surgical treatment for aortic arch disease requiring periods of circulatory arrest is associated with a spectrum of neurological sequelae. Cerebral oximetry can non-invasively monitor patients for cerebral ischaemia even during periods of circulatory arrest. We hypothesized that cerebral desaturation during circulatory arrest could be described by a mathematical relationship that is time-dependent. Cerebral desaturation curves obtained from 36 patients undergoing aortic surgery with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) were used to create a non-linear mixed model. The model assumes that the rate of oxygen decline is greatest at the beginning before steadily transitioning to a constant. Leave-one-out cross-validation and jackknife methods were used to evaluate the validity of the predictive model. The average rate of cerebral desaturation during DHCA can be described as: Sct(o(2))[t]=81.4-(11.53+0.37 x t) (1-0.88 x exp (-0.17 x t)). Higher starting Sct(o(2)) values and taller patient height were also associated with a greater decline rate of Sct(o(2)). Additionally, a predictive model was derived after the functional form of a x log (b+c x delta), where delta is the degree of Sct(o(2)) decline after 15 min of DHCA. The model enables the estimation of a maximal acceptable arrest time before reaching an ischaemic threshold. Validation tests showed that, for the majority, the prediction error is no more than +/-3 min. We were able to create two mathematical models, which can accurately describe the rate of cerebral desaturation during circulatory arrest at 12-15 degrees C as a function of time and predict the length of arrest time until a threshold value is reached.
