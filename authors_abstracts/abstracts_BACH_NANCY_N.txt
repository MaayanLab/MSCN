Primary biliary cirrhosis: environmental risk factors.
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an autoimmune disease of unclear etiology. It is a chronic, progressive condition that causes intrahepatic ductal destruction ultimately leading to symptoms of cholestasis, cirrhosis and liver failure. The disease predominantly affects middle aged Caucasian women. It has a predilection to certain regions and is found in higher incidences in North America and Northern Europe. It also has a genetic predisposition with a concordance rate of 60% among monozygotic twins. Combinations of genetic and environmental factors are proposed in the pathogenesis of this disease with a compelling body of evidence that suggests a role for both these factors. This review will elucidate data on the proposed environmental agents involved the disease's pathogenesis including xenobiotic and microbial exposure and present some of the supporting epidemiologic data.

Atorvastatin does not improve liver biochemistries or Mayo Risk Score in primary biliary cirrhosis.
Statin treatment reduces hypercholesterolemia and may be anti-inflammatory. Case reports noted decreased alkaline phosphatase and histological improvement following statin treatment in primary biliary cirrhosis. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term effects of statin treatment in primary biliary cirrhosis. A retrospective analysis compared clinical and biochemical data from 15 hypercholesterolemic individuals with primary biliary cirrhosis who were treated long-term with atorvastatin with an age and gender matched, primary biliary cirrhosis control group. A significant decrease in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (p < or = 0.002) was observed throughout atorvastatin treatment (median time 2.5 years). LDL-cholesterol levels in the control group were not significantly changed after 2 years (p > 0.050). No significant changes were noted in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and Mayo Risk Score in either group (p > 0.05). Long-term atorvastatin treatment reduced LDL-cholesterol in primary biliary cirrhosis, but there was no evidence of any anti-inflammatory effect.

Anti-CD16 autoantibodies and delayed phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in primary biliary cirrhosis.
Primary biliary cirrhosis is characterized by chronic hepatic inflammation and immune mediated apoptosis of bile duct epithelial cells. Delayed macrophage phagocytosis of opsonized apoptotic cells, noted in other autoimmune diseases, may promote inflammation. Recent studies suggest serum anti-CD16 autoantibodies contribute to impaired macrophage phagocytosis by blocking complement receptor 3 (CR3) signaling via CD16. Therefore, serum anti-CD16 levels and the ability of monocyte derived macrophages from individuals with PBC to phagocytosis apoptotic cells were compared to controls. The mean level of anti-CD16 IgM autoantibodies (0.86+/-0.62 v. 0.35+/-0.22, respectively, p=0.031) was increased in PBC compared to control sera, and mean PBC phagocytosis of opsonized apoptotic cells was significantly decreased compared to controls (23.9+/-12.2% v. 43.9+/-14.4%, respectively, p=0.020). However, PBC phagocytosis of opsonized apoptotic cells was not significantly affected by the presence or absence of autologous serum (20.8+/-13.5% v. 23.9+/-12.2%, respectively, p=0.560). PBC phagocytosis of opsonized apoptotic cells inversely correlated with CD16 (and CR3) expression levels on Day 5 after culture in the presence or absence of autologous serum (r=-0.546, p=0.033 and r=-0.519, p=0.042, respectively). Phagocytosis of non-opsonized apoptotic cells did not correlate with CD16 or CR3 expression (p>0.050). In conclusion, PBC macrophage phagocytosis of opsonized apoptotic cells is impaired, irrespective of serum factors and may increase hepatic inflammation.

Transplantation trends in primary biliary cirrhosis.
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has shown efficacy in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), a chronic, slowly progressive disease. We hypothesized that UDCA use would reduce the need for liver transplantation in PBC. Our study's aim was to assess liver transplantation requirements in PBC over a 12-year period. For comparison, we studied patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) because it shares similar characteristics to PBC, but with a decreased response to UDCA. PBC and PSC transplant data of first-time liver recipients from the United Network for Organ Sharing database were collected from 1995 to 2006. The absolute number of liver transplantations in the United States increased an average of 249 transplants per year (P < .001). The absolute number of transplants performed for PBC decreased an average of 5.4 cases per year (P = .004). The absolute number of transplantations for PSC showed no statistical change (P = .621). The trends for the absolute number of individuals added to the transplant waitlist showed a similar pattern: (1) an increase in total listings for transplants of all diagnoses (beta = 265; P = .001); (2) a decrease in PBC (beta = -12.1; P < .001); (3) and no change for PSC (beta = -5.434; P = .083). The liver transplantation burden of PBC in the United States decreased between 1995 and 2006. This is despite an increase in total liver transplants and no change in transplant rates for PSC.
