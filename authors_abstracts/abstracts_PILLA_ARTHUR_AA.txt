Effects of Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields on IL-1beta and Post Operative Pain: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Pilot Study in Breast Reduction Patients.
BACKGROUND:: Surgeons seek new methods of pain control to reduce side effects and speed post-operative recovery. Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) are effective for bone and wound repair and pain and edema reduction. This study examined whether the effect of PEMF on post-operative pain was associated with differences in levels of cytokines and angiogenic factors in the wound bed. METHODS:: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study, 24 patients, undergoing breast reduction for symptomatic macromastia, received PEMF therapy configured to modulate the calmodulin-dependent nitric oxide signaling pathway. Pain levels were measured by a visual analog scale, and narcotic use was recorded. Wound exudates were analyzed for IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, VEGF, and FGF-2. RESULTS:: PEMF produced a 57% decrease in mean pain scores at 1 hour (P < 0.01), and a 300% decrease at 5 hours (P < 0.001), persisting to 48 hours post-op in the active versus the control group, along with a concomitant 2.2-fold reduction in narcotic use in active patients (P = 0.002). Mean IL-1beta concentration in the wound exudates of treated patients was 275 % lower (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences found for TNF-alpha, VEGF, and FGF-2 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS:: PEMF therapy significantly reduced post-operative pain and narcotic use in the immediate post-operative period. The reduction of IL-1beta in the wound exudate supports a mechanism that may involve manipulation of the dynamics of endogenous IL-1beta in the wound bed via a PEMF effect on nitric oxide signaling, which could impact the speed and quality of wound repair.
