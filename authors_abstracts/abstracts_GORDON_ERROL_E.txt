Recurrent vasospasm after endovascular treatment in subarachnoid hemorrhage.
the frequency and predictors of recurrent symptomatic and angiographic vasospasm after angioplasty or intra-arterial chemical vasodilatation (IACV) in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are not well characterized. a retrospective review of serial clinical and angiographic data was conducted between 7/2001-6/2008 on spontaneous SAH patients who underwent endovascular therapy for symptomatic vasospasm. of 318 SAH patients, symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 80 (25%) and endovascular intervention was performed on 69 (22%) patients. Of these 69 patients, all received IACV in 274 vessels and 33 also underwent angioplasty in a total of 76 vessels. Recurrent angiographic vasospasm occurred in the same vessel segment in 9/23 (39%) patients who received both angioplasty + IACV compared to 40/49 (82%) of patients who received IACV alone (P < 0.001). Recurrent symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 10/26 (38%) angioplasty + IACV patients compared to 28/37 (76%) patients who received IACV alone (P = 0.003). The modified-Fisher Score, A1 spasm, distal and multi-vessel vasospasm predicted recurrent angiographic spasm after IACV alone (P < 0.05). Procedural complications occurred in 4% of IACV alone patients and 6% of angioplasty + IACV patients (P = 0.599). recurrent angiographic or symptomatic vasospasm is not uncommon after angioplasty + IACV, but appears to occur significantly less than after IACV alone, without any increase in procedural complications.

Trend in outcome and financial impact of subdural hemorrhage.
Little current data exists regarding outcome, cost, and length of stay (LOS) after subdural hemorrhage (SDH). We sought to examine predictors of discharge disposition, ICU and hospital LOS and direct, indirect, ICU, surgical, and diagnostic costs for SDH. A retrospective review was conducted of 216 SDH patients, aged >18 years admitted to our hospital between 1/2001 and 12/2008. Discharge disposition was characterized as dead, poor or good. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of disposition, LOS, and cost. Of 216 SDH patients, the median age was 74 (19-95), and the median admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 14 (3-15). The SDH was characterized as acute in 14%, subacute in 44%, chronic in 12%, and mixed in 30%. Surgical evacuation was performed in 139 (64%) patients. Death occurred in 29 (13%) patients and poor disposition in 43 (20%). Significant predictors of death included age, admission GCS, and hospital LOS (P < 0.05). Longer hospital LOS was associated with poor disposition, while shorter ICU LOS was associated with good disposition (P < 0.01). Median hospital LOS was 8 (1-99) days. Median total direct costs for hospitalization were $10,670 ($907-238,856). ICU and hospital LOS were significant predictors of all measures of cost (P < 0.05). SDH size, chronicity, and surgical intervention were not predictors of any outcome. There was no significant change in any outcome variable between 2001 and 2008. Despite good admission neurological status, death or poor discharge disposition is common after SDH. LOS and costs remain high and have not improved in the last decade.
