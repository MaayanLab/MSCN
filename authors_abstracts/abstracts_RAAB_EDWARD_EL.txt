Questions revisited: is experience still the best teacher?
To illustrate the value of experience in developing a simplified binocular sensory evaluation when required by necessity, and to describe the experience gained in repeating and extending a prior study. Prioritizing the information needed and the tests that provide it, and retrospectively reviewing a new population with similar inclusion and exclusion requirements, and dealing with the problem of uneven follow-up. It is possible to derive a limited evaluation that is still sufficient for patient management. The prior results were confirmed and led to better understanding of the possibilities and limitations of retrospective studies.
