Allergic contact dermatitis: patch testing results at Mount Sinai Medical Center.
Patch testing is an important diagnostic tool commonly used to identify allergens responsible for allergic contact dermatitis, especially in cases where the diagnosis is not clearly apparent. The authors report the patch test results from 2004-2008 and compare the results with the North American Contact Dermatitis Group and Mayo Clinic. Four hundred thirty-four patients with suspected allergic contact dermatitis underwent standardized patch testing with a tray consisting of 50 allergens at Mount Sinai Medical Center. Two hundred ninety patients (66.8%) had positive reactions to at least one allergen. The most frequent contact allergens included nickel sulfate (13%), fragrance mix (9.6%), propylene glycol (7.8%), neomycin sulfate (6.6%), thimerosal (6.4%), bacitracin (6.2%), and sodium gold thiosulfate (5.8%).

The use of the 308-nm excimer laser for the treatment of psoriasis.
The objective was to study the effectiveness of the 308-nm excimer laser for the treatment of various forms of localized stable psoriasis. Recent reports show that 308-nm excimer laser may be an effective and safe method for the treatment of localized stable psoriasis. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed of a population-based group of 98 patients with various forms of localized stable psoriasis treated with excimer laser. Of these, 41 were male, and 57 were female patients. Ages ranged from 10 to 84 years (mean, 51.4 years). Patients who completed at least 10 sessions were included unless they had achieved >70% improvement in PASI scores before 10 treatments. The initial dose was determined by the MED (minimal erythema dose), and the dose was raised gradually in a stepwise fashion. Significant improvement (?70%) was achieved by 59 (60.2%) patients; they needed an average cumulative dose of 6.46?J/cm(2), and an average of 17 sessions. Twenty-four (24.5%) patients achieved good improvement (50% to 70%); the average cumulative dose needed was 5.36?J/cm(2), and the average number of sessions required was 12. Side effects were limited to sunburn-like reaction. The 308-nm excimer laser is an effective and safe modality for the treatment of psoriasis, with good results achieved in a relatively short time.
