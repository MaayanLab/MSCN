Chemotherapy for gynecologic cancers.
This review highlights significant recent developments and trends in chemotherapy for major gynecologic malignancies, i.e., ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, uterine sarcomas, gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, and cervical cancer. In ovarian cancer, chemotherapeutic options for early, advanced and recurrent disease are in the adjuvant setting as well as in the neoadjuvant setting are explored. For uterine cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy is employed for high risk epithelial subtypes with early disease, such as uterine papillary serous carcinomas, uterine carcinosarcomas and leiomyosarcomas, advanced stage cases, as well as recurrent disease. The review then proceeds to further discuss the appropriate treatment based on the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics prognostic scoring system for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Finally, chemotherapy is utilized in cervical cancer as neo-adjuvant therapy prior to surgery or radiation, as a sensitizer concomitantly with radiation therapy or for the treatment of advanced and recurrent disease.
