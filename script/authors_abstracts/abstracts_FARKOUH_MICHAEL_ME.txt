Long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with angina pectoris presenting with bundle branch block.
Long-term outcomes of unselected patients with angina pectoris and bundle branch block (BBB) on initial electrocardiogram are not well established. The Olmsted County Chest Pain Study is a community-based cohort of 2,271 consecutive patients presenting to 3 Olmsted County emergency departments with angina from 1985 through 1992. Patients were followed for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) including death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization at 30 days and over a median follow-up period of 7.3 years and for mortality only through a median of 16.6 years. Cox models were used to estimate associations between BBB and cardiovascular outcomes. Mean age of the cohort on presentation was 63 years, and 58% were men. MACEs at 30 days occurred in 11% with right BBB (RBBB), 8.8% with left BBB (LBBB), and 6.4% in patients without BBB (p = 0.17). Over a median follow-up of 7.3 years, patients with BBB were at higher risk for MACEs (RBBB, hazard ratio [HR] 1.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.44 to 2.38, p <0.001; LBBB, HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.56, p <0.001) compared to those without BBB. Over a median of 16.6 years, the 2 BBB groups had lower survival rates than patients without BBB (RBBB, HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.78, p <0.001; LBBB, HR 3.32, 95% CI 2.67 to 4.13, p ?0.001), but after adjustment for multiple risk factors an increased risk of mortality for LBBB remained significant. In conclusion, appearance of LBBB or RBBB in patients presenting with angina predicts adverse long-term cardiovascular outcomes compared to patients without BBB.

Relationships among regional arterial inflammation, calcification, risk factors, and biomarkers: a prospective fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography imaging study.
Fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (FDG PET) imaging of atherosclerosis has been used to quantify plaque inflammation and to measure the effect of plaque-stabilizing drugs. We explored how atherosclerotic plaque inflammation varies across arterial territories and how it relates to arterial calcification. We also tested the hypotheses that the degree of local arterial inflammation measured by PET is correlated with the extent of systemic inflammation and presence of risk factors for vascular disease. Forty-one subjects underwent vascular PET/computed tomography imaging with FDG. All had either vascular disease or multiple risk factors. Forty subjects underwent carotid imaging, 27 subjects underwent aortic, 24 subjects iliac, and 13 subjects femoral imaging. Thirty-three subjects had a panel of biomarkers analyzed. We found strong associations between FDG uptake in neighboring arteries (left versus right carotid, r=0.91, P<0.001; ascending aorta versus aortic arch, r=0.88, P<0.001). Calcification and inflammation rarely overlapped within arteries (carotid artery FDG uptake versus calcium score, r=-0.42, P=0.03). Carotid artery FDG uptake was greater in those with a history of coronary artery disease (target-to- <0.01) and in males versus females (target-to- <0.05). Similar findings were also noted in the aorta and iliac arteries. Subjects with the highest levels of FDG uptake also had the greatest concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers (descending aorta target-to- =0.53, P=0.01; carotid target-to- =0.50, P=0.01). Nonsignificant positive trends were seen between FDG uptake and levels of interleukin-18, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein. Finally, we found that the atheroprotective biomarker adiponectin was negatively correlated with the degree of arterial inflammation in the descending aorta (r=-0.49, P=0.03). This study shows that FDG PET imaging can increase our knowledge of how atherosclerotic plaque inflammation relates to calcification, serum biomarkers, and vascular risk factors. Plaque inflammation and calcification rarely overlap, supporting the theory that calcification represents a late, burnt-out stage of atherosclerosis. Inflammation in one arterial territory is associated with inflammation elsewhere, and the degree of local arterial inflammation is reflected in the blood levels of several circulating biomarkers. We suggest that FDG PET imaging could be used as a surrogate marker of both atherosclerotic disease activity and drug effectiveness. Prospective, event-driven studies are now underway to determine the role of this technique in clinical risk prediction.

Diminished benefits of drug-eluting stents versus bare metal stents in patients with severe renal insufficiency.
Since their introduction, the use of drug-eluting stents (DES) has increasingly become standard practice due to their decreased rates of in-stent restenosis and target lesion revascularization (TLR) rates in comparison to bare metal stents (BMS). However, these benefits have not been reproduced in patients with severe renal disease (SRD). This study compared TLR rates in patients with severe renal insufficiency treated with DES vs. BMS. Between 2003 and 2006, we collected data on 6,220 consecutive patients receiving either DES or BMS. Both groups were similar in angiographic and clinical variables. TLR rates at 270 days and 1 year were then compared between patients receiving DES or BMS with varying creatinine clearance (CrCl). At 1 year after PCI, TLR rates were significantly lower for DES in patients with CrCl >60 (5 vs. 9.3%; p < 0.0001). However, in patients with CrCl <40 ml/min or on dialysis there was no significant difference in TLR rates for DES vs. BMS. While DES showed improved clinical outcomes in patients with normal and mildly impaired renal function, they showed no benefit over BMS in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency. Coupled with the possibly increased risk of late stent thrombosis with DES, BMS may be a more appropriate and safer stent in this population.

Usefulness of diabetes mellitus to predict long-term outcomes in patients with unstable angina pectoris.
The objective of this study was to determine short- and long-term cardiovascular outcomes in unselected patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) with acute ischemic chest pain (AICP). In patients with DM presenting to the emergency department with AICP, short-term cardiovascular outcomes remain discordant between trials and registries, whereas long-term outcomes are not well-described. A consecutive cohort of all residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, presenting with AICP from January 1, 1985, to December 31, 1992, was followed for a median duration of 16.6 years. The primary outcome was long-term all-cause mortality. Other outcomes included a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization (major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events [MACCEs]) as well as heart failure (HF) events at 30 days and at a median of 7.3 years, respectively. Of the 2,271 eligible patients, 336 (14.8%) were classified with DM. The crude 30-day MACCE rate was 10.1% in patients with DM and 6.1% in those without DM (p = 0.007). HF events were more common in patients with DM at 30 days (9.8% vs 3.1%, p <0.001). At 7.3 years, patients with DM were more likely to experience MACCEs and HF events than those without DM (71.2% vs 45.1%, unadjusted hazard ratio 2.15%, 95% confidence interval 1.87 to 2.48, p <0.001, and 45.1% vs 18.2%, p <0.001, respectively). Over the follow-up period, 272 patients with DM (81.9%) died, compared with 936 (49.2%) without DM (p <0.001). In conclusion, DM is associated with a higher short-term risk for MACCEs and HF and a higher long-term risk for mortality in unselected patients with AICP. DM should be included as a high-risk variable in national acute coronary syndrome guidelines.

Is measuring C-reactive protein useful for guiding treatment in women > or = 60 years and men > or = 50 years of age?
Using the results of the JUPITER trial, a recent report estimated that up to 11 million older United States (US) adults with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels > or =2 mg/L not currently recommended statins may benefit from treatment. However, the need to measure CRP in making this treatment decision has not been evaluated. Using data from 887 older US men and women (men > or =50 years old, women > or =60 years old) not currently on or recommended statin therapy participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 to 2006, we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of patient characteristics in identifying the presence of CRP > or =2 mg/L. If CRP > or =2 mg/L were included as an indication for statin therapy, then 90% of older US adults would be recommended treatment. Patients with CRP > or =2 mg/L were more likely (p <0.05) to be current smokers, obese, and have chronic kidney disease. However, characteristics (including demographics, cigarette smoking, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic syndrome) had low positive predictive values (<70%) for identifying patients with CRP > or =2 mg/L and negative predictive values (<60%) for those with CRP <2 mg/L. In conclusion, these findings suggest patient characteristics cannot be easily used to identify patients with CRP > or =2 mg/L. Given the demonstrated benefits of statin therapy, cost of measuring CRP, and large percentage of older US adults with high CRP, universal statin therapy for older US adults warrants investigation.

Crushed clopidogrel administered via nasogastric tube has faster and greater absorption than oral whole tablets.
To compare the absorption of 300 mg clopidogrel administered crushed via nasogastric (NG) tube versus whole tablets taken orally in healthy volunteers. Earlier antiplatelet therapy has proven benefits in treatment of myocardial infarction and in patients undergoing PCI. Aspirin can be delivered early in crushed form via NG tube after CABG surgery to prevent graft occlusion. If clopidogrel given crushed via NG tube provides faster absorption, it could allow earlier clopidogrel loading. Nine healthy human subjects (34.7 +/- 11.1 years, 5 males) were given 300 mg clopidogrel in crushed form via NG tube with 30 mL water after 8 hours of fasting. Plasma levels of the primary circulating inactive clopidogrel metabolite SR26334 were measured after 20 minutes, 40 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours of dosing. Following >or=2 week washout, same subjects swallowed 300 mg clopidogrel (four 75 mg tablets) after an 8-hour fasting and SR26334 levels were measured at the same time points. Plasma SR26334 concentrations peaked earlier after crushed delivery than after oral intake (44 vs. 70 minutes, P = 0.023) and the median peak was 80% higher (13,083 vs. 7,255 ng/mL, respectively, P = 0.021). At 40 minutes, area under the curve was almost twofold greater with NG administration than oral administration (geometric means ratio = 0.5299, 95% CI = 0.28-0.99, P = 0.048), but was similar over the 24-hour period with both administration methods (geometric means ratio = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.84-1.32, P = 0.646). A 300 mg loading dose of crushed clopidogrel administered via NG tube provides faster and greater bioavailability than an equal dose taken orally as whole tablets. The clinical benefits of this strategy need to be investigated.

An evidence-based review of the cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), both nonselective and cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors, are commonly used medications for the relief of acute and chronic pain associated with a wide range of medical conditions. Because of the extensive use of these agents, adverse events that occur infrequently may still affect the overall risk/benefit ratio of this class of medications. Serious adverse cardiovascular (CV) events have been reported with NSAID use, but unfortunately, definitive evidence regarding the precise CV risk associated with these drugs, as a class and individually, is lacking. Therefore, it is an issue of public health importance that physicians be guided by careful assessment of the existing evidence to make reasonable choices in prescribing these medications. The investigators review the key clinical trials, meta-analyses of clinical trials, and epidemiologic studies on the subject of the CV safety of NSAIDs and identify key variables that define the CV risk of the NSAIDs. In conclusion, it is important that cardiologists, who are not among those physicians frequently prescribing NSAIDs, have a particular responsibility to have up-to-date, thoughtfully synthesized information about the CV risks of these drugs, especially when administered to patients receiving low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection.

Optimal treatment of the diabetic patient with multivessel disease.
Diabetes is emerging as a major source of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The atherosclerosis associated with diabetes has a complex etiology with even more complicated manifestations, such as multivessel and diffuse coronary disease. The optimal management of the diabetic patient with multivessel disease poses a special challenge in terms of the selection of the revascularization strategy and medical therapies. In this article, we assess the evidence accumulated to date and discuss ongoing studies that will help better inform this intricate decision-making process.

Serum cystatin C and increased coronary heart disease prevalence in US adults without chronic kidney disease.
Previous studies indicated that serum cystatin C, a marker of renal function, was associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, few data about this association are available for persons without chronic kidney disease or albuminuria. Data from 4,991 subjects in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with an estimated glomerular filtration rate > or =60 ml/min/1.73 m2 without micro- or macroalbuminuria were analyzed. Subjects were categorized into quartiles of serum cystatin C and compared for prevalence of CVD. CVD was defined as a history of myocardial infarction, angina, or stroke. After age standardization, prevalences of CVD from the lowest to highest quartile of serum cystatin C were 6.0%, 8.8%, 11.8%, and 16.7% (p-trend = 0.006). Also, age-standardized prevalences of myocardial infarction across quartiles of serum cystatin C were 1.9%, 4.4%, 6.6%, and 8.6%; age-standardized prevalences of angina were 2.4%, 4.4%, 4.2%, and 7.1%; and age-standardized prevalences of stroke were 2.5%, 1.6%, 3.5%, and 4.4% (each p-trend <0.05). Each 1-SD higher serum cystatin C level was associated with a multivariate prevalence ratio of CVD of 1.55 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13 to 2.13), and multivariate-adjusted prevalence ratios were 1.44 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.07), 1.64 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.64), and 1.65 (95% CI 1.06 to 2.56) for myocardial infarction, angina, and stroke, respectively. In conclusion, a graded association exists between higher serum cystatin C and increased CVD prevalence in patients without established chronic kidney disease.

Chagas disease as a mechanistic model for testing a novel hypothesis.
The association between depression and cardiovascular disease is well documented. Nevertheless, the process through which they are linked remains unknown, as does the direction of this relationship. Studies have suggested both that depression is a risk factor for heart disease and that heart disease is a risk factor for depression. A number of studies have established that a relationship exists between depression and inflammation, with alterations in the levels of inflammatory markers (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha and others). Depressive symptoms have also been identified in many diseases characterized by inflammatory processes e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, bronchial asthma, diabetes, tuberculosis and cardiovascular diseases. In this brief viewpoint, we explain and propose how to use Chagas disease, a disorder characterized by inflammatory processes and leading to cardiovascular and autonomic problems, as a model for studying the directionality of the relationship between heart disease and depression.

Design of the Future REvascularization Evaluation in patients with Diabetes mellitus: Optimal management of Multivessel disease (FREEDOM) Trial.
Prior randomized trials suggested that revascularization of diabetic patients by coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) produced results superior to balloon angioplasty. The introduction of drug-eluting stents (DESs) calls into question the relevance of past studies to the current era. The FREEDOM Trial is designed to determine whether CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the superior approach for revascularization of diabetic patients. The FREEDOM Trial is a multicenter, open-label prospective randomized superiority trial of PCI versus CABG in at least 2000 diabetic patients in whom revascularization is indicated. Consenting diabetic patients with multivessel disease will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either CABG or multivessel stenting using DESs and observed at 30 days, 1 year, and annually for up to 5 years. At the discretion of the primary physician or interventionalists, patients randomized to the PCI/DES arm will receive any approved DESs. The primary outcome measure is the composite of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke. Patients will be observed for a mean of 4 years. At present, coronary revascularization with CABG surgery is the treatment of choice in diabetic patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. Drug-eluting stents have shown promising preliminary results in the diabetic population. The FREEDOM Trial is an international study designed to define the optimal revascularization strategy for the diabetic patient with multivessel coronary disease.

Role of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in the development of atherosclerosis.
Insulin resistance (IR) is the underlying defect in >90% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the major pathologic mechanism for the associated susceptibility to premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). The progression of IR to diabetes parallels the progression of endothelial dysfunction to atherosclerosis. The downregulation of the antiatherogenic phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-mediated insulin receptor-signaling pathway, and maintained activity of the proatherogenic mitogenic-activated protein kinase pathway in insulin-resistant states, leads to accelerated atherosclerosis. Efforts to prevent or slow the epidemic of atherothrombotic CVD must focus on the reversal of the disturbances in glucose and lipid homeostasis through the amelioration of IR.

New insights into the link between cardiovascular disease and depression.
Although the association between depression and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is well documented, the underlying mechanisms for this relationship remain unclear. In this paper, we present three possible models which account for the comorbidity between depression and cardiovascular disease. The first model outlines depression as a risk factor for CVD and the second model presents CVD as a risk factor for depression. The third model proposes a common underlying pathway related to the effects of chronic stress on the body in manifesting as depression or cardiovascular disease. If the proposed model holds true, it may be possible that an intervention initiated before overt manifestations of CVD or depression become apparent, may delay or prevent the onset of these serious clinical entities.

Cardiovascular outcomes in high risk patients with osteoarthritis treated with ibuprofen, naproxen or lumiracoxib.
Evidence suggests that both selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors and non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increase the risk of cardiovascular events. However, evidence from prospective studies of currently available COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs is lacking in patients at high cardiovascular risk who are taking aspirin. To determine the cardiovascular outcomes in high risk patients with osteoarthritis treated with ibuprofen, naproxen or lumiracoxib. The Therapeutic Arthritis Research and Gastrointestinal Event Trial (TARGET) of 18 325 patients with osteoarthritis comprised two parallel substudies, comparing lumiracoxib (COX-2 inhibitor) with either ibuprofen or naproxen. A post hoc analysis by baseline cardiovascular risk, treatment assignment, and low-dose aspirin use was performed. The primary composite end point was cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke at 1 year; a secondary end point was the development of congestive heart failure (CHF). In high risk patients among aspirin users, patients in the ibuprofen substudy had more primary events with ibuprofen than lumiracoxib (2.14% vs 0.25%, p = 0.038), whereas in the naproxen substudy rates were similar for naproxen and lumiracoxib (1.58% vs 1.48%, p = 0.899). High risk patients not taking aspirin had fewer primary events with naproxen than with lumiracoxib (0% vs 1.57%, p = 0.027), but not for ibuprofen versus lumiracoxib (0.92% vs 0.80%, p = 0.920). Overall, CHF developed more often with ibuprofen than lumiracoxib (1.28% vs 0.14%; p = 0.031), whereas no difference existed between naproxen and lumiracoxib. These data suggest that ibuprofen may confer an increased risk of thrombotic and CHF events relative to lumiracoxib among aspirin users at high cardiovascular risk. The study indicates that naproxen may be associated with lower risk relative to lumiracoxib among non-aspirin users. This study is subject to inherent limitations, and therefore should be interpreted as a hypothesis-generating study.
