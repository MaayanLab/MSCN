Allergic contact dermatitis: patch testing results at Mount Sinai Medical Center.
Patch testing is an important diagnostic tool commonly used to identify allergens responsible for allergic contact dermatitis, especially in cases where the diagnosis is not clearly apparent. The authors report the patch test results from 2004-2008 and compare the results with the North American Contact Dermatitis Group and Mayo Clinic. Four hundred thirty-four patients with suspected allergic contact dermatitis underwent standardized patch testing with a tray consisting of 50 allergens at Mount Sinai Medical Center. Two hundred ninety patients (66.8%) had positive reactions to at least one allergen. The most frequent contact allergens included nickel sulfate (13%), fragrance mix (9.6%), propylene glycol (7.8%), neomycin sulfate (6.6%), thimerosal (6.4%), bacitracin (6.2%), and sodium gold thiosulfate (5.8%).
