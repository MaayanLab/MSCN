An assigned teaching resident rotation.
The authors' adult psychiatry residency training program identified several educational needs for residents at their institution. Junior residents needed enhanced learning of clinical interviewing skills and learning connected to the inpatient psychiatry ward rotations, and senior residents needed opportunities to prepare for the specialty board exam and to develop teaching skills in preparation for attending positions. Changing the residency program structure and implementing a Teaching Resident rotation addressed these needs simultaneously. The authors describe the responsibilities of the teaching resident, the role of the teaching resident in the program, and instruction in educational methods. Residents shared their perceptions of the new teaching resident rotation in an anonymous survey. PGY-1, PGY-2, and the PGY-4 residents found the teaching resident rotation helpful in many areas of their learning. Service requirements were not compromised and highly valuable educational objectives were achieved for both the PGY-4 teaching residents and the PGY-1 and PGY-2 residents whom they taught. An intensive teaching rotation for senior residents who teach junior residents and medical students is an effective way to deal with systemic changes in psychiatric education.
