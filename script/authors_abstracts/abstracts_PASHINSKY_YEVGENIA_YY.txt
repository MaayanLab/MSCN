Gastroesophageal reflux disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease occurs with a higher prevalence in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis than in matched controls. Silent reflux occurs in about a third of patients with significant gastroesophageal reflux disease; thus, objective measurements are required to evaluate gastroesophageal reflux disease in patients with advanced lung diseases. We provide here a detailed description of acid and non-acid reflux and the diagnostic evaluation for pulmonologists and lung transplant surgeons suspecting reflux as a contributing factor in advanced lung diseases. We review the evidence for gastroesophageal reflux disease causing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other select pulmonary diseases and the potential role of antireflux surgery in the management of advanced lung disease and transplant patients.
