Lacrimal canalicular transplantation with composite eyelid graft.
To describe a new surgical approach for secondary repair of canalicular lacerations using a full-thickness en bloc eyelid transplantation. This a single case report of full-thickness en bloc eyelid transplantation. The patient presented with symptomatic epiphora several years after traumatic laceration of the left lower canalicular system. The canalicular system of the right upper eyelid, including the punctum and a section of the canaliculus, was resected and transplanted to repair a dysfunctional left lower eyelid. The primary outcome measure was the functionality of the transplanted canalicular system. The transplanted lacrimal system was patent by irrigation at multiple visits postoperatively. In addition, the patient was asymptomatic and was pleased with the cosmetic result. This is the first reported case of successful canalicular transplantation. Although a single case report, the authors anticipate future success with this technique.
