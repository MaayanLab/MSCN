Underuse of breast cancer adjuvant treatment: patient knowledge, beliefs, and medical mistrust.
Little is known about why women with breast cancer who have surgery do not receive proven effective postsurgical adjuvant treatments. We surveyed 258 women who recently underwent surgical treatment at six New York City hospitals for early-stage breast cancer about their care, knowledge, and beliefs about breast cancer and its treatment. As per national guidelines, all women should have received adjuvant treatment. Adjuvant treatment data were obtained from inpatient and outpatient charts. Factor analysis was used to create scales scored to 100 of treatment beliefs and knowledge, medical mistrust, and physician communication about treatment. Bivariate and multivariate analyses assessed differences between treated and untreated women. Compared with treated women, untreated women were less likely to know that adjuvant therapies increase survival (on a 100-point scale; 66 v 75; P < .0001), had greater mistrust (64 v 53; P = .001), and had less self-efficacy (92 v 97; P < .05); physician communication about treatment did not affect patient knowledge of treatment benefits (r = 0.8; P = .21). Multivariate analysis found that untreated women were more likely to be 70 years or older (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.13), to have comorbidities (aRR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.12), and to express mistrust in the medical delivery system (aRR, 1.003; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.007), even though they were more likely to believe adjuvant treatments were beneficial (aRR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98 to 0.99; model c, 0.84; P < or = .0001). Patient knowledge and beliefs about treatment and medical mistrust are mutable factors associated with underuse of effective adjuvant therapies. Physicians may improve cancer care by ensuring that discussions about adjuvant therapy include a clear presentation of the benefits, not just the risks of treatment, and by addressing patient trust in and concerns about the medical system.

A tracking and feedback registry to reduce racial disparities in breast cancer care.
Black and Hispanic women with early-stage breast cancer are more likely than white women to experience fragmented care and less likely to see medical oncologists to get effective adjuvant treatment. We implemented a tracking and feedback registry to close the referral loop between surgeons and oncologists. We compared completed oncology consultations and use of adjuvant treatment among a group of 639 women with newly diagnosed stage I or II breast cancer who had undergone surgery at one of six New York City hospitals from 1999 to 2000 with the same outcomes for a different group of 300 women with breast cancer whose surgeries occurred in 2004-2006, after the implementation of the tracking registry. Underuse of adjuvant treatment was defined as no radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery, no chemotherapy for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors, or no hormonal therapy for ER-positive tumors 1 cm or larger. We used hierarchical modeling to adjust for clustering within hospital and surgeon practice. Odds ratios were converted to adjusted relative risks (aRRs). All statistical tests were two-sided. Implementation of the tracking and feedback registry was accompanied by a statistically significant increase in oncology consultations (83% before vs 97% after the intervention; difference = 14%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11% to 18%; P < .001) and decrease in underuse of adjuvant treatment (23% before vs 14% after the intervention; difference = -9%, 95% CI = -12% to -6%; P < .001). Underuse declined from 34% to 14% among black women, from 23% to 13% among Hispanic women, and from 17% to 14% among white women (chi-square of change in underuse from before to after among the three racial groups; P = .001). In multivariable models adjusting for clustering by hospital and surgeon, the intervention was associated with increased rates of oncology consultation (aRR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.3 to 1.8), and reduced underuse of adjuvant treatment (aRR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.6 to 0.9). Compared with the preintervention findings, minority race was no longer a risk factor for low rates of oncology consultation (aRR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.7 to 1.3) or for underuse of adjuvant therapy (aRR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.8 to 1.3). A tracking and feedback registry that enhances completed oncology consultations between surgeons and oncologists also appears to reduce rates of adjuvant treatment underuse and to eliminate the racial disparity in treatment.

What affects time to care in emergency room appendicitis patients?
Emergency departments (EDs) provide a safety net for seriously ill individuals. Little is known about factors that affect time to diagnosis and treatment of patients with time-sensitive conditions within the ED. Retrospective observational study of 236 appendicitis patients examining patient factors and ED characteristics with time to a surgeon's diagnosis of appendicitis and ED length of stay (LOS). Time to surgeon's diagnosis and ED LOS were slower for nonwhite patients without private insurance (parameter estimate = 0.38, P = 0.002 and 0.31, P < 0.001, respectively) and quicker for patients for whom the ED physician's diagnostic first impression was appendicitis (parameter estimate = -0.29, P = 0.003 and -0.14, P = 0.04, respectively). Greater numbers of physicians staffing the ED had a modest effect on time to surgeon diagnosis and ED LOS (parameter estimate = -0.04, P = 0.01 and -0.04, P = 0.01, respectively), whereas greater numbers of patients had little impact (parameter estimate = -0.005, P = 0.04 and -0.002, P = 0.28, respectively). Minority patients without private insurance had slower times to specialist consultation and treatment; ED staffing and census had a small effect. To maximize patient safety and ED quality of care, administrators should ensure timely specialist consultation and determine additional mechanisms facilitating white privately insured patients' quicker care.

Understanding reasons for underuse: an approach to improve quality and reduce disparities in breast cancer treatment.
Effective adjuvant treatments proven to prolong survival for breast cancer exist, yet many women, particularly minority women, do not receive them. Little work has focused on improving the quality of, and reducing racial disparities in, cancer treatment. We describe the application of a conceptual model to direct, design, and implement trials to reduce underuse of effective adjuvant breast cancer treatments. Content analysis of extensive interviews and focus groups was used to construct a framework of patient, physician, and system-level reasons for underuse. Use of the model then directed development of targeted interventions aimed at ameliorating underlying causes. The process of identifying patient, physician, and system-level reasons for underuse involved patients, surgeons, surgeon's office staff, and providers of patient assistance. Engaging these individuals both informed the design of our multi-focused interventions and generated interest in trial participation. All 38 surgeons in six unaffiliated institutions and all 25 patient assistance programs approached agreed to participate in the intervention trials. Identifying reasons for underuse by interviewing patients, physicians, physician office staff, and allied care providers about episodes in which needed care failed to occur helps engage key individuals, and can inform the design and implementation of interventions targeting barriers to delivering high quality breast cancer care to all.

Lost opportunities: physicians' reasons and disparities in breast cancer treatment.
Women with breast cancer do not consistently receive adjuvant treatments that have been shown to increase survival. Acquiring an understanding of the reasons for these lost opportunities may inform strategies for quality improvement. Interviews were conducted with surgeons treating 119 women who did not receive guideline-recommended adjuvant therapy to ascertain reasons underlying treatment omission. Primary reason for underuse was categorized as not recommended, recommended but declined, or system failure (treatment recommended, not refused but did not ensue). Logistic regression identified patient characteristics, and surgeons' practice and referral patterns associated with underuse. Surgeons did not recommend adjuvant treatment for 41 (34%) of 119 women, most often because perceived risks exceeded benefits (37 of 119; 31%); unawareness of treatment benefits was rare (four of 119; 3%). Among the 78 (66%) of 119 for whom surgeons recommended treatment, 37 (31%) declined therapy; 41 (34%) system failures occurred. System failures occurred more commonly among minority than white women (73% v 54%; P < .01), and more commonly in women who were receiving Medicaid or were uninsured than those with Medicare or commercial insurance (54% v 19%; P < .01). Women treated by a surgeon who works closely with oncologists were less likely to experience a system failure (84% v 68%; P < .05). One third of underuse episodes were attributable to surgeons' perceptions that treatment was not indicated, one third because women did not accept recommendations, and one third were the result of system failures. Reasons for underuse of adjuvant breast cancer treatments appear multifactorial and this heterogeneity suggests the need for simultaneous development of different strategies to improve care.
